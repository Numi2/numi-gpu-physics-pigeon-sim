## Feather appearance and visibility

- J. R. Padrón-Griffe et al., “A Surface-based Appearance Model for Pennaceous Feathers,” *Computer Graphics Forum* 43(4), 2024: https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.15235
- Project page and supplemental material: https://graphics.unizar.es/projects/FeathersAppearance_2024/
- Authors' MIT reference implementation, inspected at revision `9af1a04722f78a7275b62afb492ea8d074499128`: https://github.com/juanraul8/PennaceousFeathersRendering

The Metal renderer ports the reference implementation's bounded analytic
barb/barbule discontinuity-ray masking construction. It does not copy assets or
claim the renderer's regular-cross-section parameters as measured
American-crow anatomy. The older projected-area approximation remains a
fallback and parity boundary.

The committed `ValidationInputs/deetjen-ob-f03-surface-v1` files are a
provenance-locked CC0 derivative of the selected Dryad flight. The uncompressed
MATLAB source remains outside this repository; the manifest records both source
SHA-256 values and every measured, derived, and assumed field.

The code in this repository is original and does not copy PyFR source. PyFR was used to study component boundaries, precompiled kernel execution, backend separation, data ownership, and command-graph organization. The numerical references above informed the choice of a regular low-Mach lattice, moving boundaries, TRT collision, and momentum-exchange loads.

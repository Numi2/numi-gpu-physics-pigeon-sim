BirdFlowMetal advances a real D3Q19 fluid state on the GPU, evaluates articulated moving boundaries, exchanges momentum with those boundaries, reduces aerodynamic force and torque, and can integrate a six-degree-of-freedom rigid body—all in one Swift/Metal package. It also includes a native scientific viewer, exact-input measured-motion replay, independent reference algebra, archived validation reports, and deliberately strict scientific acceptance gates.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Scientific status:** the coupled vertical slice is complete and the fixed-thickness prescribed flapping-wing canonical is quantitatively accepted. Complete measured-bird and free-flight results are **not** yet publication-ready. The repository keeps those boundaries explicit instead of converting engineering success into an aerodynamic claim.

## Deetjen dove through flight

The new flight direction preserves the complete Deetjen OB F03 source
trajectory instead of subtracting body translation for a presentation loop.
It advances all `144` non-periodic surface frames from `0...143 ms` through the
Metal moving-boundary solver. The measured-derived body center has endpoint
displacement `[0.187064, 0.044940, -0.008277] m` while body, bilateral wings,
and tail retain their source timing and fixed indexed topology.

```bash
./Scripts/run-deetjen-through-flight.sh
```

The first locked D8 RR3 engineering run completed `4,576/4,576` fluid steps
with finite loads and positive sampled populations. Its report is
[`deetjen-dove-through-flight-v1.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-through-flight-v1.json),
and the direction/claim contract is
[`Docs/DEETJEN_DOVE_THROUGH_FLIGHT.md`](Docs/DEETJEN_DOVE_THROUGH_FLIGHT.md).
This is prescribed-motion CFD at the existing D8 engineering viscosity. It is
not yet source-viscosity experimental agreement or load-responsive free flight.

[![Deetjen through-flight observatory](Docs/Media/deetjen-through-flight-observatory.png)](Docs/Media/deetjen-through-flight-observatory.mp4)

The artifact-locked observatory follows the raw translating surface, draws the
144-sample body-centroid path, and synchronizes the D8 RR3 vertical-force trace
and positivity state. Generate and verify it with
`./Scripts/capture-deetjen-through-flight-observatory.sh`. It now renders the
actual read-back CFD field on 26 archived body-following transverse planes at
`x = body - 0.22 m`: blue/orange is signed streamwise vorticity and luminance
includes positive Q. Interpolation between archived planes is presentation-only;
translucent wing history and wingtip ribbons remain explicitly kinematic.

### American crow simulation

![Native Metal simulated American crow holding a quiet stance, unfolding into takeoff, and continuing through flight](Docs/Media/american-crow-standing-to-flight-v1.gif)

The American-crow study combines the locked Deetjen dove deformation scaffold,
published crow morphometric ranges, screened public CT anatomy, current feather
appearance measurements, and species-specific anatomy constraints. Every frame
shown above comes from the native Metal renderer—there is no
crow photograph or generated target image in this README. The linked
[Metal wingbeat](Docs/Media/american-crow-hybrid-native-v1.mp4) executes the
estimated geometry and material on Apple silicon. The GIF retains simulated
topology through a quiet standing hold, geometric wing deployment, leg
retraction, liftoff, and sustained flapping; it contains no image dissolve or
reference footage. The live dorsal covert courses now add LOD-selected,
vane-contained rachis and paired aggregate-barb ribbons without opening a new
simulated wing gap. The formerly single trailing-covert sheet now deploys as
two overlapping physical ranks over a continuous hidden feather bed; each rank
owns its own contained shafts and barb bundles. In takeoff and flight, those
two exposed ranks are now generated from `124` stable current/previous root
records by the retained Metal template path instead of being rebuilt as CPU
triangles; the darker continuity bed remains underneath them.
The body-to-wing handoff now also follows deployment instead of leaving every
axillary vane in its grounded caudal direction: follicles and estimated lengths
remain body-owned while the vane directions and normals blend toward the live
inner-wing topology. The body-seated folded shell retains stable geometry
records but collapses to zero area as the articulated wing takes ownership, and
showcase-scale humeral/scapular vanes promote their edge bundles into contained
interior barb bundles. Their five terminal aggregates now retain the same tips
but begin from a deterministic body-feather-specific root fan instead of one
repeated axial line. These are simulated presentation constraints, not measured
American-crow feather linkages.
The same retained path now owns all `12` rectrices throughout takeoff. Their
stable roots unfold from the compact standing stack into the open-flight pose
over transition progress `0.08...0.62`, while preserving full vane morphology
and current/previous state. The former second CPU-authored takeoff tail has been
removed; the procedural tail remains only as the sustained-wingbeat oracle.
Across rear-level, right-low-quarter, and high-front 17-frame audits, enclosed
hole pixels fall from `535` to `359`, components from `198` to `190`, and the
largest hole from `38` to `29` pixels while the `4` expected lower-body pixels
remain exact. The targeted `38`-pixel high-front tail/wing cavity is absent.
The folded live-wing sheet now also narrows smoothly from `52%` to `94%` span,
ending in a `10-14 mm` lateral envelope shared by every topology-bound covert.
Previously its `40-50 mm` width continued to the distal station and appeared as
two upright blades above the tail from overhead views. Three new 17-frame
left-high, overhead, and right-high probes remove those outer blades, reduce
aggregate enclosed pixels from `1,019` to `1,010`, preserve zero expected
apertures, and leave the separate `156`-pixel near-vertical component unchanged.
Identity-class tracing resolves that component as a view-specific
cranial-to-pedal projection aperture: it touches head,
throat, body-feather, and foot classes but no femoral/crural class, and it
disappears under small yaw/pitch changes. Filling it with torso geometry would
therefore be anatomically incorrect. This is estimated presentation geometry,
not a measured folded-wing width.
The folded secondary stack now also tucks only its posterior end into the
rectrix handoff. An identity-AOV trace at the reverse quarter found that the
apparent lower-tail plate was one terminal class-`2` vane (`0x0b0a0102`), not
a torso opening. Its centerline lateral offset now eases from the unchanged
`27 mm` anterior value to `11 mm` at the terminal feather, while a sixth-power
envelope narrows only that terminal width to `82%`; live-flight geometry is
unchanged. In the accepted `800 x 450` reverse-quarter gate that owner is fully
occluded, with `14` enclosed pixels in `10` components and a `5`-pixel worst
component. The opposite rear quarter retains a closed body/wing-root silhouette
with `18` enclosed pixels in `15` components and a `3`-pixel worst component.
These are simulated standing-morphology and raster checks, not measured crow
folded-secondary dimensions.
The retained rectrices keep nonzero terminal vanes instead of collapsing to
generic needle points. Medial and outermost pairs retain the original
`13-16%` envelope, while only the three sublateral bilateral pairs broaden to
`19.0-20.1%` where their tips hand off beneath the folded/deploying wing. Their
centerline tips remain at full asset length, lateral vertices retain the
`1.0-1.4%` roundback, and stable identity/topology are unchanged. In the
rear-port 17-frame stress audit, enclosed-hole pixels/components/worst channel
fall from `593/157/28` to `165/121/8`; a new rear-port grazing view remains
discrete rather than forming a tail plate. These are bounded simulated
morphology and raster checks, not measured American-crow tip dimensions.
The quiet tail now keeps its `4 mm` root tent but converges to a `2 mm` total
terminal depth instead of `6 mm`. Adult American-crow rectrices are described
as [smooth and squared or truncated](https://doi.org/10.22621/cfn.v123i2.691),
and the [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service](https://www.fws.gov/lab/featheratlas/id-position.html)
notes that ordinary tail feathers do not have finger-like tips. This
standing-only convergence removes the background ladder between otherwise
overlapping terminal vanes without widening them or changing flight. In the
same `1200 x 675` reverse-quarter A/B, enclosed pixels/components/worst
component fall `47/30/5 -> 4/2/3`; rectrix-to-rectrix exterior slots fall from
`7` runs and `10` pixels to one `1`-pixel run. A fresh elevated rear-starboard
view retains individual layers with `2/1/2` enclosed metrics and zero rectrix
slots. No reference image is rendered or stored.
At the full close-detail tier, those same `12` retained rectrices now expose
`2,880` contained aggregate-barb vertices from their already allocated Metal
template. The barbs remain collapsed at lower coverage and their rachis ribbons
remain suppressed: an explicit-shaft candidate was rejected because it formed
long parallel wires over the closed tail. In a new `1200 x 675` elevated
rear-quarter A/B, active coverage stays `216,275` pixels, enclosed holes stay
`3` one-pixel components, the expected lower-body aperture stays zero, and
rectrix-to-rectrix exterior slots stay zero. The accepted barbs raise local
same-class luminance variation from `0.001235` to `0.001502` without changing
the `0.105038` class maximum. This is simulated close-range mesostructure, not
a measured barb count or a perceptual-realism qualification.
The exact identity AOV now also reports visible and fully covered pixels for
every persistent primary, secondary, and rectrix as schema `18`. The same
report retains the longest exterior-connected row/column slots with exact
boundary classes, packed identities, and procedural owners, so open shoulder
gaps are traceable without treating every silhouette concavity as a defect.
Each class luminance maximum now retains its exact pixel coordinate, and a
wing-cell owner must also carry the low-alpha scaffold material. Bare pedal
keratin can therefore no longer alias the numerically overlapping first wing
cell.
That census
traced the early takeoff double-spear to the overlap-expanded terminal primary
on each side, not to generic primary-tip anatomy. Those two folded oracles now
transfer over progress `0.08...0.28`; all other remiges retain the existing
`0.08...0.62` handoff, and topology-bound live primaries stay pointed. At the
stressed frame, terminal-primary visibility falls `593 -> 206`, `8,633 ->
1,122`, and `1,913 -> 126` pixels across three new lateral/rear views while
their complete hole pixel/component/largest-component metrics remain exact.
This is an estimated presentation ownership schedule, not measured deployment.
The middle live covert course also retains its full folded relief, then seats
its deployed root camber and clearance to `48%` across the first `12` span
stations; vane width, chord, identity, and the caudal handoff remain unchanged.
Posterior class-`5` body plumage now follows the same deployment state: dorsal
contour and mantle crown settle into the closed torso while showcase-scale
dorsal vanes replace coarse edge aggregates with contained interior barb pairs.
The exposed outer class-`6` scapular field now seats beneath the live wing root
as deployment advances: its transverse crown settles from `0.12` to `0.08`,
and retained rachis/barb geometry follows the same vane envelope instead of
remaining on a buried centerline. Interior barbs stop at `97%` of the owning
vane width, five bounded terminal bundles complete each tip, and all emitted
detail keeps the parent class-`6` AOV identity. Follicles, centerline tips,
widths, inventory, and standing anatomy remain unchanged.
Resolved cervical, mantle, humeral, and scapular vanes now use a five-strip
transverse crown once an individual feather reaches `24` final-output pixels.
The prior three-strip tier exposed a broad planar center facet and repeated it
as coherent shoulder ribs. Sub-`24 px` silhouettes remain one strip, while the
existing close/offline tiers remain five and seven strips. A first proximal-
underlayer candidate was rejected for opening a sawtooth neck seam; suppressing
explicit body raches was also rejected because it did not remove the ribs. At a
new `1200 x 675` rear-port yaw/pitch `(-1.74,0.38)` A/B, active coverage stays
exactly `164,876` pixels, enclosed holes stay `8/8/1`, and the expected lower-
body aperture stays zero. Fully covered pixels change by only `+3`; class-`5`
and class-`6` peak luminance remain exact while local neighbour variation rises
by `4.28%` and `5.29%`, respectively. This is simulated screen-space feather
refinement, not measured crow morphology or proof of perceptual equivalence.
Body raches now follow a coupled transverse-resolution contract instead of
surviving because a feather is merely long. Below `12 px` vane width the
analytic shaft lobe is absent, it fades in through `24 px`, and explicit
tubular rachis geometry is promoted only at `24 px`; close future-compute views
therefore recover both layers. At a previously unused high rear-port view
`(-1.08,0.58)` from `0.48 m`, active pixels change only
`193,941 -> 193,927`, one-pixel holes improve `7 -> 6`, the worst hole stays
one pixel, and the expected aperture stays zero. Class-`5` and class-`6` peak
luminance remain exact while same-class neighbour contrast falls `8.2%` and
`32.8%`, removing the engraved-groove read without smoothing away feather
edges. These thresholds are simulated optical LOD, not measured visual acuity.
Aggregate body-barb stations now retain their ten-pair budget but no longer
repeat one exact axial ruler across every cervical, mantle, humeral, and
scapular vane. Existing stable feather identity offsets each bilateral station
by at most `18%` of one inter-station spacing; ordered stations cannot cross,
and all terminal bundles, roots, tips, radii, and AOV classes remain unchanged.
At a new close-oblique `1200 x 675` view `(-0.34,0.46)` from `0.36 m`, active
coverage remains exactly `307,367` pixels, fully covered pixels change by `+1`,
the worst hole stays `6` pixels, and the expected aperture stays `3` pixels.
Tiny enclosed holes change `27/18 -> 29/19` pixels/components. The localized
A/B is `0.998958` SSIM and the crop shows de-locked edge strokes rather than a
broad material change. This spacing is simulated mesostructure, not a measured
American-crow barb map.
At the opposite standing diagnostic view, the humeral/scapular base spectrum
and broader optical lobe reduce class-`6` mean scene-linear luminance by
`8.31%`, standard deviation by `10.57%`, and same-class neighbour contrast by
`8.55%` with the exact `5,988` visible pixels retained. This keeps anatomical
scapular overlap while removing its pale-plate read; it is a simulated
material refinement, not calibrated feather reflectance.
Interior class-`7` pectoral and abdominal feathers now retain a subvane
continuity shaft and add a second four-segment rachis on the visible `0.07`
transverse crown. Boundary rows, terminal courses, and all edge-barb aggregates
remain unchanged, so higher-quality breast detail cannot become a new body
silhouette. Identity-stable lateral centerline sweeps break coherent transverse
highlight rows while returning exactly to each root and tip. A bounded
`0.78...1.22` identity-stable crown scale breaks the remaining breast-row
specular lock while driving both the visible vane and retained rachis. The body
material resolves paired optical barb banks about the same feather-local axis;
these future-compute lobes alter roughness response without adding silhouette
geometry. The `776` visible crown shafts are now retained as `112`-byte
analytic records. At showcase LOD a compact `3,104`-interval work list drives
Metal expansion into `74,496` temporal/AOV vertices instead of authoring those
tubes on the CPU. The continuity and barb oracle remains in the accepted body
surface stream; future meshlet or hardware-curve emission can consume the same
records without reducing the `1,304`-feather ventral inventory.
The first projected-size handoff now consumes those same records when an
individual feather reaches `480` final-output pixels. Each eligible feather
then resolves `72` identity-varied barb pairs per side as four connected,
crown-following intervals; its coarse edge aggregates are retired while the
explicit curves own temporal position, normal, class, and primitive identity.
At the deliberately extreme `0.035 m`, `800 x 450` diagnostic, `746` records
are projected-size candidates for `429,696` intervals and `10,312,704`
triangle-stream vertices. Metal now classifies conservative feather bounds
against six world-space frustum planes, performs a deterministic record scan,
emits only compacted interval work, and prepares indirect draw arguments. The
raster stage now pulls each procedural vertex directly from that GPU-resident
work instead of materializing a candidate-sized triangle stream. At a fresh
front-flank yaw/pitch `(0.80, -0.15)`, `487` visible records generate
`6,732,288` vertices while materialized-output residency remains zero. All five
beauty PNGs and every pre-existing non-duration AOV field are exact against the
former compute-expanded path; normal-distance rendering is exact with zero
active work. The fully simulated hold-to-flight GIF therefore remains
unchanged. This is a future-compute fidelity tier, not a measured-anatomy or
GPU-speed claim. A conservative previous-frame max-depth hierarchy now removes
only records whose complete projected bound was covered by nearer resolved
device depth; reset, camera motion, background, edge-touching, and uncertain
projections fail open. At a fresh yaw/pitch `(0.98, -0.05)`, it culls `2` of `620-638`
frustum-visible records on each non-reset frame, avoiding `27,648` procedural
vertices while adding a `1,919,424`-byte depth hierarchy. All five close PNGs,
all pre-existing raster/AOV fields, and the five-frame normal-distance path are
exact against the non-occlusion renderer. This is an executable correctness and
scaling step, not a speed claim.

A second independent handoff now activates only when a retained class-`7`
feather reaches `800` final-output pixels. Each explicit parent barb owns six
barbules on each of two crossed branches. Their endpoint coordinates remain
inside `93%` of the owning vane half-width, radii taper from an estimated `12`
to `4 um`, primitive IDs are stable, and a bounded `0.82...0.98` paired-branch
occlusion term darkens the lower crossed branch without changing opacity or
silhouette. Mixed LOD records share one GPU work scan: offsets count emitted
work rather than records, the compact work buffer grows on demand, and raster
still pulls vertices without a materialized output stream. At the fresh
`1200 x 675` yaw/pitch `(0.90, -0.12)` grazing diagnostic, `392` visible
barbule owners generate `16,257,024` procedural vertices and win `369` exact
identity pixels. The ordinary view and established `800 x 450`, `0.035 m`
close tier remain byte-exact against `dcc638f`; that close tier retains `746`
barb candidates and zero barbule candidates. These are renderer-estimated
geometry and local occlusion, not measured crow barbule dimensions, physical
self-shadowing, or a speed claim. Capability-gated Metal mesh-stage emission
now consumes the same compact GPU work directly: one threadgroup emits eight
indexed ring vertices and eight flat-shaded triangles instead of duplicating
24 triangle-stream vertices. A `4096`-wide two-dimensional indirect grid keeps
mesh coordinates below the one-dimensional `65,535` boundary, linearizes the
authoritative work index in shader, and discards only padded final-row groups.
The supported-device default is now mesh emission; the existing vertex-pulling
path remains the exact fallback and explicit audit oracle. On the M4 Pro, both
paths retain `746` candidates, `621` visible owners, `357,696` emitted
intervals, and `8,584,704` logical procedural vertices in the established close
diagnostic, while mesh invokes `2,861,568` output vertices. All five PNGs and
every non-duration/non-mode AOV field are exact, including the three non-reset
frames that each depth-cull two complete records. At the mixed `1200 x 675`
barbule tier, both paths retain `557` parent and `392` barbule owners, generate
`23,956,992` logical vertices, and give `369` pixels to exact barbule identity;
mesh invokes `7,985,664` vertices and remains byte-exact. This qualifies
cross-stage raster ownership and indexed vertex reuse on the M4 Pro; it is not
a speed claim. Resolved barb and barbule tubes now carry their retained curve
tangent into the fragment stage. Their raster/depth geometry owns visibility,
so the far-field surface mask is no longer applied a second time and their
anisotropic response follows the actual curve rather than a reconstructed vane
axis. An executable Metal probe verifies that surface-mask strength cannot
change an explicit fiber, that rotating its tangent changes its fiber lobe, and
that unresolved vanes still respond to the analytic construction. This is
curve-resolved direct visibility, not feather-to-feather ray tracing, multiple
scattering, or a measured American-crow optical calibration.
A separate versioned optics profile now drives the live eight-wavelength
air/keratin/melanin film response. It records comparative glossy-corvid
constraints independently from the renderer's American-crow estimates, so the
subtler sheen is reproducible without presenting a figure trace, photograph,
or related species as measured target data.
Its view-dependent barb, proximal-barbule, distal-barbule, and transmission
weights now use a constant-time analytic discontinuity-ray mask ported from the
authors' MIT reference implementation. The previous projected-area
approximation remains a deterministic fallback. The construction is exact for
that idealized regular cross section, not for measured American-crow anatomy or
explicit individual feather curves.
The shared trunk loft now preserves a broader ventrolateral pectoral envelope
through the sternum and fades that relief before the caudal pelvis. It moves
the body surface and its already-attached contour follicles together while
leaving every anatomical ring station, hip, hock, foot contact, and feather
inventory unchanged. Femoral vanes also use one `0.035 m` topology-LOD
reference in standing and takeoff, so quiet pose motion cannot promote a single
feather into a different detail tier. This is an estimated presentation shape,
not a measured American-crow body cross-section.
The caudal body shell now carries `168` rump-to-rectrix contour vanes in seven
overlapping rows instead of `120` in five. They retain the existing tube,
clearance, material, and projected-size hierarchy, including future rachis,
barb, and barbule tiers. Three fixed underbody/dorsal audits keep every
silhouette-slot, enclosed-hole, and expected-aperture metric exact; the added
density remains on the rump surface rather than filling the real open
wing-tail separation with a sheet.
The body-to-leg transition now retains the same `270` estimated femoral vanes
per side but gives only rows `6...11` at mid-thigh courses `8...9` a bounded
width-and-tip overlap. Those exact owners were localized from the temporal
identity AOV rather than by filling the much larger, intentional spaces between
retracting toes. In the high-side 17-frame probe this closes the nine-pixel
insertion opening: aggregate enclosed holes fall from `145` pixels in `75`
components to `135` in `73`, while the zero expected-aperture count and
`33`-pixel worst articulated-foot hole remain unchanged. Underbody and
front-starboard hole totals remain exact. Feather roots, hip/hock/ankle/digit
coordinates, inventory, and identities do not change.
A locked
`2,157`-vertex, `3,968`-triangle estimated-hybrid surface now also passes the
live Apple-Metal geometry and production TRT moving-boundary coupling gates.
The complete [model and evidence boundary](Docs/AMERICAN_CROW_MODEL.md) keeps
the generated hero, executable render, and solver surface distinct from crow
aerodynamic validation. A versioned
[bird-reality asset](Docs/BIRD_REALITY_ASSET.md) now binds `54` stable flight
and tail feather identities to the surface; retained Metal passes transport
their current/previous frames and generate the rendered vane triangles. A
native [HDR and temporal AOV contract](Docs/CROW_TEMPORAL_AOVS.md) now emits
scene-linear beauty, albedo/material, normalized normal/coverage, metric depth,
current-to-previous pixel motion, and exact integer identity before tone
mapping. A capability-gated MetalFX path consumes linear HDR, resolved device
depth, and motion while a separate native-resolution render acts as the
promotion oracle. The
[reality roadmap](Docs/BIRD_REALITY_ROADMAP.md) defines the ordered HDR,
geometric-LOD, physical-material, ray-tracing, and neural-residual gates without
showing a real-crow target as simulation output. A separate
[standing-anatomy contract](Docs/CROW_STANDING_ANATOMY.md) uses only private
qualitative observations from the supplied public clip: the simulated bird now
has a loop-closed grounded pose, folded GPU feathers, paired tarsometatarsi,
three forward digits and an opposing hallux per foot, planted contacts, and
millimetric idle motion. No source frame or video byte is copied into the repo.

## Why this project is interesting

- **One coupled stack:** fluid populations, articulated geometry, moving-wall treatment, topology changes, load extraction, and body dynamics live in one executable system.
- **GPU-resident science:** production stepping, geometry preparation, diagnostics, load reduction, Q criterion, marching cubes, pathlines, and rendering all use Metal.
- **Estimator-independent checks:** boundary loads close against fluid momentum storage and control-surface flux; free flight also closes direct fluid + body + wing momentum against far-field, sponge, and gravity impulse.
- **Negative results are first-class artifacts:** rejected operators, failed gates, source locks, phase histories, and exact thresholds are committed beside accepted results.
- **Measured-motion ready:** periodic left/right stroke, deviation, pitch, and twist are replayed with consistent pose and physical angular rates; exact input bytes and SHA-256 are retained.
- **No hosted macOS bill:** Swift and Metal validation is intentionally local. This repository contains no GitHub Actions workflows.

## Formation Flight Observatory

![Figure-eight cinematic Formation Flight Observatory with two phase-shifted measured-derived Deetjen doves, archived c20 wake evidence, an exact D3Q19 collision-streaming lens, and phase-resolved force vectors](Docs/Media/formation-flight-observatory.gif)

BirdFlowMetal can now place a leader and follower in the same D3Q19 fluid,
assign each an independent wingbeat phase, and resolve force, root torque, and
actuator power per flyer. The first gate uses two copies of the accepted
prescribed hovering-wing canonical, so it studies multi-body wake interaction
without waiting for another bird dataset. The cinematic native Metal view uses
two phase-shifted copies of the locked Deetjen OB F03 measured-derived complete
dove surface: `2,157` vertices and `3,968` triangles per flyer over source
frames `27...121`, followed by a velocity-matched `14 ms` presentation closure.
The intentional `Δφ=0.25` leader/follower offset remains. V11 renders no HUD,
label, or text panel and moves the camera through a smooth spherical
figure-eight: one yaw cycle and two smaller pitch lobes expose multiple upper,
lower, and side-quarter views without losing either bird or breaking the loop.

The new living wake bridge is evidence-bound. Three ridges follow vorticity and
vertical velocity from the archived c20 fields; cyan-to-violet color encodes
wake age, while luminance follows all `4,820` samples of the passed c18 leader
`q5 [0,0,+1]` reflected-population trace. A small follower-plane ring is only a
presentation locator. All `48/48` phases keep the field at full opacity, with
cyclic linear interpolation between adjacent members of the 21-state c20
archive to remove visual stepping. That interpolation is for presentation
continuity only and is never used for forces, power, or validation. V9 also
removes the misleading diagonal dark seam left by the hidden canonical solid
mask and low-vorticity centerline: a mask-aware Gaussian display filter fills
only that invisible solid gap from surrounding archived fluid samples, while
joint vorticity/vertical-velocity opacity keeps the blue jet continuous. These
are presentation transforms; the archived c20 arrays remain unchanged.

V10 adds a scientific D3Q19 lattice lens on a real positive-`x` c20 wake
ridge. Its center is the rest/collision population, six cyan axial nodes and
twelve violet face-diagonal nodes are the complete moving stencil, and packets
travel outward on all 18 links to visualize local streaming. The gold
`q5=[0,0,+1]` packet is modulated by the passed phase-resolved leader boundary
source trace, making the moving-boundary momentum-exchange connection visible
without pretending that the lens is force-bearing geometry. A faint cube is
only the lattice-cell frame; its eight corners are not populations. The lens,
like the dove replay, is presentation-only.

This is the kinetic update used by the solver: the 19 populations collide
locally, the 18 moving populations stream to their neighbors, and their density
and momentum moments recover the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations in the
low-Mach limit. That locality is also why the production update maps efficiently
to Metal GPU threads. At a moving wing link, reflected and corrected populations
transfer momentum to the articulated boundary; the phase-resolved q5 cue makes
that solver-to-load path visible without replacing the archived load ledger.

V11 closes that visible chain with one depth-tested vector on each flyer. Vector
direction is the cyclically interpolated three-component resultant force from
the `100` archived c20 phase bins; vector length uses a square-root display map
of magnitude normalized independently by each flyer's cycle maximum. The arrows
therefore show when and where the archived aerodynamic resultant points, but are
not scale drawings and do not create a new force estimate. They share one GPU
triangle batch with the D3Q19 lens, so the added scientific layer costs no new
per-glyph draw calls and never enters collision, streaming, or load reduction.

The renderer now draws into `RGBA16Float`, applies a half-resolution 25-tap
selective bloom and bounded highlight shoulder, then composites once into the
sRGB GIF surface. Wake ribbons are joined into one degenerate triangle-strip
batch instead of allocating and drawing every ribbon separately. The 25-tap
kernel uses `69%` fewer texture samples than the rejected 81-tap prototype.
An encoded high-edge-density audit was added after visual inspection caught a
transient vertex-buffer binding error; the corrected loop restores the dove
surface buffer explicitly before its wire pass.

The dove surfaces, wingtip guides, wake ridges, and marker do not enter
voxelization or fluid stepping; archived CFD and loads remain the prescribed
wing canonical. The right wing remains a documented bilateral-reflection
assumption and the tail retains its bounded presentation scale. The original
scientific stop is unchanged: c16-to-c20 force change is `10.68%` against a
frozen `5%` limit, while source curvature remains mixed at `0.884`. The
48-frame forward-only loop is pixel-seamless, its encoded seam is `0.973x` the
median adjacent-frame change, and its maximum high-edge density is only
`1.164x` the median. The expanded deterministic V11 visual audit passes `65/65`
checks while keeping quantitative formation benefit and
biological claims fail-closed.

```bash
swift run birdflow validate formation-flight \
  --chord-cells 8 --cycles 3 \
  --offset-z -4 --phase-offset 0.25 \
  --archive ValidationArtifacts/formation-flight-c8-z4-phase025
```

Every coupled case runs matched leader-only and follower-only controls. Mean
positive actuator power is the primary energy measure, and the run fails if
the wings overlap or if the two owner loads do not close to the unchanged
production solver total. The three-cycle c8 `z/c=-4`, `Δφ=0.25` case closes
force at `4.65e-7` and torque at `6.10e-6` in cycle-global relative L-infinity
norm, with zero overlapping voxels. The follower uses `3.69%` less mean positive
power than its matched isolated control, while the two-flyer system uses `2.14%`
less. The last-two-cycle power difference is `10.26%`, below the frozen `20%`
coarse-screen limit. This is an interaction hypothesis; the completed 12/16-cell
promotion below tests refinement and does not clear it. The preregistered
eight-case quick screen is
now complete: all cells pass, savings span `1.21%...7.91%`, and the strongest
cell is `z/c=-3`, `Δφ=0.25` with a `4.56%` two-flyer system reduction. Because
no c8 cell produced a penalty, the frozen largest-penalty selector honestly
collapses to the smallest-saving `1.21%` cell rather than manufacturing a
negative control.
The selected five-cycle c16 extrema now complete the preregistered
discriminator. Maximum/minimum savings are `11.916%`/`3.738%`, with final-cycle
power differences of `2.34%`/`2.83%`, zero overlap, and owner closure below
`1.3e-6` force and `4.3e-6` torque. The c16 best-minus-minimum contrast is
`8.178` percentage points. That is `1.519` points (`18.57%`) above c12, while
the maximum itself changes `18.77%` from c12 to c16. The solver and accounting
are cleared, but neither the absolute interaction magnitude nor its phase
contrast is grid-converged; no quantitative formation-benefit claim is made.

![Phase-aligned c12/c16 formation power, lift, and drag discrimination with the fine-pair residual highlighted](Docs/Media/formation-flight-phase-refinement-atlas.png)

The archived phase histories localize why the fine pair remains open without
running more CFD. The normalized power-discrimination residual peaks at
follower phase `0.745`; just 21 of 100 bins carry half its absolute magnitude,
and the fixed quarter/three-quarter-cycle midstroke neighborhoods carry
`42.3%`. Its absolute magnitude correlates with the lift and drag residuals at
`0.757`/`0.760`, pointing to a phase-localized aerodynamic refinement problem
rather than a scalar normalization artifact.

A separate audit confirms that the acceptance checks do not mutate or clamp
solver output. The promoted reports have `36.5x` conservation headroom and
`7.07x` final-cycle repeatability headroom. Fixed upper bounds at 24
cells/chord, 20 cycles, and 12 chord offsets have been removed: device memory,
checked arithmetic, and exact representability now determine the feasible
study size. Physical validity and conservation checks remain intact.

The preregistered c20 maximum-selector measurement is now complete. Saving
increases from `11.916%` at c16 to `13.341%` at c20, a `10.68%` fine-pair
change against the frozen `5%` continuation limit. Every solver gate passes:
zero overlap, `7.17e-7` force closure, `4.42e-6` torque closure, and `2.366%`
cycle repeatability. The failure is therefore unresolved grid dependence, not
accounting or stationarity. The sequential rule stops the c20 minimum run and
saves another roughly two hours while retaining the negative result.

![Preregistered c20 maximum-selector refinement, phase power residual, and GPU-resident midstroke field envelope](Docs/Media/formation-flight-c20-stage1-atlas.png)

![Four actual c20 Formation Observatory wake fields at paired midstroke phases, with signed vertical velocity, vorticity contours, owner silhouettes, common physical scales, and the stopped preregistered decision](Docs/Media/formation-flight-c20-cfd-phase-plate.png)

The phase plate enlarges four of the archived GPU fields with a common signed
vertical-velocity scale and common vorticity contour levels. Cyan and orange
show the leader and follower ownership masks. The phase rail shows all 20
requested midstroke captures; no temporal interpolation is used. This makes
the wake topology visually inspectable without weakening the negative
convergence result.

Twenty compact GPU-resident field captures cover the diagnosed
follower-midstroke bands without changing populations or loads. The
capture-on/off smoke is report-identical and agrees with the previous CPU
vorticity extraction to `1e-9` maximum absolute difference. All 21 c20 slices
are finite, indexed by both leader and follower-local phase, and SHA-locked by
the discriminator summary. Quantitative formation benefit remains
unauthorized.

The c16/c20 normalized power-waveform residual peaks at follower phase `0.055`
with magnitude `0.112`; only `23.15%` lies in the earlier midstroke bands and
its absolute magnitude tracks drag residual (`r=0.683`) rather than lift.
This redirects the next diagnostic toward an early-cycle coupled-only field
comparison instead of another full refinement ladder.

That preregistered early-cycle comparison is now complete. A fail-closed field
replay runs only the coupled case, but accepts its fields only if the exact
configuration, grid, cycle length, owner closure, periodicity, and complete
100-bin coupled history reproduce a passed full report. Both c16 and c20
histories reproduce exactly. Their combined runtime falls from `9139.12 s` to
`3861.10 s`—a measured `2.37x` speedup saving `87.97 min` without reducing
cycles or field phases.

![Early-cycle c16/c20 Formation Observatory spatial discriminator showing signed vertical velocity, the common-grid residual, phase metrics, and the mixed mechanism classification](Docs/Media/formation-flight-early-cycle-field-discriminator.png)

Across follower phase `0.005...0.095`, signed vertical velocity changes only
`7.26...7.62%` normalized RMS and remains correlated at `r≥0.9972`, while
vorticity changes `19.15...23.64%`. The normalized residual evolves from
near-boundary dominated early in the window to wake dominated late; its
aggregate near-boundary fraction is `45.04%`, inside the preregistered mixed
band. The strongest absolute near-boundary probe is phase `0.035` around
`(x/c,z/c)=(1.82,1.02)`; the strongest wake probe is phase `0.095` around
`(2.32,-1.13)`. An independent implementation passes `99/99` checks. This
localizes the next instrumentation but does not authorize a quantitative
formation-benefit claim.

That instrumentation is now complete. A read-only Metal diagnostic decomposes
the exact production owner load at the two selected phases into
reflected-population, interpolation-auxiliary, moving-wall, cover, and uncover
work. The c8 smoke and promoted c16/c20 replays reproduce their locked coupled
histories exactly; maximum component closure remains below `2.32e-7` force,
`1.34e-7` torque, and `8.16e-8` actuator power.

![Formation Flight causal mechanism atlas with exact work decomposition and selected c16/c20 wake residuals](Docs/Media/formation-flight-causal-mechanism-atlas.png)

At follower phase `0.035`, moving-wall work accounts for `50.43%` of the
normalized c20-minus-c16 component change and interpolation for an opposing
`34.69%`; neither reaches the preregistered `60%` dominance threshold. At
phase `0.095`, `74.72%` of residual energy is outside the half-chord boundary
band. The frozen result is therefore wake-transport dominated, with an
independent `106/106` audit. Strong cancellation is explicit: the two
grid-difference condition numbers are `16.67` and `14.93`, so this localizes
the mechanism without declaring an individual large work term defective.

The follow-up asks whether that wake difference is merely displaced. It
requires no new CFD: `441` bounded shifts at each of five locked phases compare
mapped c16 signed vertical velocity and vorticity against c20 in the selected
wake region.

![Formation wake transport discriminator comparing unshifted and optimally aligned residual fields](Docs/Media/formation-flight-wake-transport-atlas.png)

Across all `2,205` alignments, registration removes only `0.852%` of residual
energy. Four phases choose zero displacement; the fifth chooses `-0.05` chord
in `x`, giving a mean `(-0.01,0.00)`-chord shift. The independently reproduced
`41/41` result is **amplitude/diffusion dominated**, not a wake-position or
phase-lag error.

The preregistered one-variable collision discriminator is now complete. A new
diagnostic-only CLI path keeps geometry, kinematics, interpolated boundary,
load estimator, grid, sponge, and gates fixed while replacing production TRT
with the previously qualified positivity-preserving RR3 operator. Population
minimum and limiter activations are fused into the existing load reduction, so
every D3Q19 population is observed on every step without a second population
memory pass. Production remains TRT.

```bash
./Scripts/run-formation-collision-dissipation.sh
```

The c8 smoke completes in `22.23 s`, stays positive at `0.01508`, and needs no
positivity correction. The five-cycle c16 RR3 run completes in `1075.62 s`,
also with zero correction activations, minimum population `0.01560`, force
closure `1.10e-6`, and torque closure `3.70e-6`. It is numerically clean—but
it moves the wrong way: relative to the locked c20 TRT discriminator, RR3
increases aggregate wake residual energy by `28.98%` and dimensionless
force-history residual energy by `84.82%`. The `51/51` independent audit
therefore stops c20 RR3 exactly as preregistered. This rules out positivity
repair as the missing formation-convergence mechanism; it does not treat c20
TRT as truth or promote either operator. A fresh production-TRT c8 replay also
reproduces its pre-instrumentation 100-bin history exactly (`0.0` relative
difference), proving the fused diagnostic is dormant when not requested.

![Collision/dissipation A/B comparing c16 TRT and RR3 residuals against the locked c20 discriminator](Docs/Media/formation-flight-collision-dissipation-atlas.png)

A second preregistered analysis uses no new CFD and divides the locked wake ROI
into three one-chord streamwise bands. The c16-to-c20 TRT residual is already
largest in the upstream band and decreases downstream: downstream/upstream
normalized residual density is `0.818`, below the frozen `1.15`
source-dominated boundary. The result is **source-amplitude dominated**, with
`94/94` independent checks—not accumulating downstream numerical attenuation.

![Streamwise wake residual localization showing upstream, middle, and downstream discrepancy density](Docs/Media/formation-flight-streamwise-attenuation-atlas.png)

The phase-resolved boundary-population source census is now complete. It uses
the exact production pre-step populations and solid mask, resolves both owners
and all D3Q19 directions at the locked follower phases `0.035` and `0.095`,
and records raw reflection, reconstructed incoming population, interpolation,
moving-wall, link-fraction, wall-kinematic, and branch totals. The diagnostic
is read-only and excludes the automatic phase-zero field capture.

```bash
./Scripts/run-formation-boundary-source-census.sh
```

The first c8 qualification deliberately failed because the host report copied
the intentionally uncaptured phase-zero slot as two zero-support samples. That
negative control is preserved and SHA-locked. The amendment changed only the
report filter, before either discriminating grid ran. The corrected c8 gate
passes with exact history replay and `1.24e-7` reconstruction residual. c16 and
c20 complete in `890.86 s` and `2293.58 s`; both reproduce their locked
histories exactly. Their maximum source-reconstruction residuals are
`9.28e-8`/`9.09e-8`, with force closure `1.14e-6`/`7.17e-7` and torque closure
`4.23e-6`/`4.42e-6`.

![Owner-, phase-, and D3Q19-resolved boundary population source census with exact c16-to-c20 product attribution](Docs/Media/formation-flight-boundary-source-atlas.png)

The preregistered primary leader sample at follower phase `0.035` attributes
`98.25%` of the c16-to-c20 source change to the areal directional link measure
and only `1.75%` to conditional per-link population amplitude. Every secondary
owner/phase sample agrees: link-sampling attribution spans
`98.08%...98.85%`. The directionwise symmetric identity closes to
`1.68e-17`; the independent raw-artifact audit passes `319/319`. This rules
out another broad collision or force-law change as the next allocation. It
does not imply a large geometric error: direction-distribution TV is only
`0.55%...0.99%`, while grid-normalized link density falls
`1.37%...2.35%`; those small changes dominate because conditional population
change is smaller still.

An immediate archive-only second identity factors the dominant link measure as
total areal link density times D3Q19 direction probability. It executes with no
new fluid solve:

```bash
./Scripts/run-formation-link-sampling-subdecomposition.sh
```

![Exact link-sampling microscope separating grid-normalized boundary-link density from D3Q19 direction redistribution](Docs/Media/formation-flight-link-sampling-subdecomposition.png)

At the frozen primary sample, areal link density supplies `47.55%` and
direction redistribution `52.45%` of the parent sampling term. Neither reaches
the frozen `60%` threshold; all four samples remain mixed. The exact identity
closes below `3.78e-17`, and an independent reconstruction passes `521/521`
checks. The next justified allocation is therefore one **geometry-only c18
bridge at the primary phase retaining both pathways**, not a bulk operator,
stopped c20 minimum, blind global c24 ladder, or production edit. Quantitative
formation benefit remains unauthorized.

That bridge is now complete under a frozen before-execution contract. It uses
the production Metal pose preparation and two-wing voxelizer, but executes
**zero fluid timesteps**:

```bash
./Scripts/run-formation-geometry-c18-bridge.sh
```

![Preregistered geometry-only c18 bridge exposing lattice-phase sensitivity in Formation Flight boundary links](Docs/Media/formation-flight-geometry-c18-bridge.png)

The cheap harness exactly reproduces every archived c16/c20 direction count
for both owners (`76/76` D3Q19 records, including the four zero rest-direction
records) before interpreting c18.
The three prescribed poses take `0.072/0.090/0.118 s` on Apple M4. At the
primary leader pose, areal link density is `33.7266`, `33.1111`, and `33.2650`
for c16/c18/c20: c18 falls below both endpoints. The frozen classifier is
therefore `latticePhaseAliasingSuspected`; normalized density, direction-TV,
and joint-profile midpoint curvatures are `0.833`, `0.503`, and `0.768`.
Independent reconstruction passes `105/105` checks. This result prevents an
expensive c18 fluid run from being misrepresented as smooth refinement. It
selected a geometry-only subcell-offset ensemble at c16/c18/c20 next.

That ensemble is now complete: a full `4 × 4 × 4` tensor of global subcell
translations at each resolution, or **192 Metal poses**, ran with zero fluid
timesteps in `3.71 s` of recorded pose/count work:

```bash
./Scripts/run-formation-geometry-subcell-ensemble.sh
```

![Formation Flight 192-pose subcell ensemble showing geometry uncertainty and restored ensemble-mean refinement](Docs/Media/formation-flight-geometry-subcell-ensemble.png)

The zero-offset cases reproduce all c16/c18/c20 bridge counts exactly. After
averaging lattice phase, c18 mean density lies between c16 and c20, while the
normalized density, direction, and joint-profile curvatures collapse to
`0.132`, `0.093`, and `0.131`, all below the frozen `0.5` boundary. The locked
classification is `aliasingAveragedOut`; independent reconstruction passes
`334/334` checks. This quantifies geometry uncertainty and clears smooth
**ensemble-mean geometry** refinement only. It does not authorize a force
correction, production edit, quantitative formation benefit, force
convergence, or biological claim.

The selected population-weighted follow-up is also complete. One deterministic
common offset, `[0.25, 0.25, 0.75]` cells, minimizes the summed
sample-SD-normalized distance from the three resolution medians (`0.826`,
versus `1.641` for the legacy zero offset). A new coupled-only diagnostic then
advances the unchanged production TRT solver for five cycles and records one
leader/follower D3Q19 boundary-source census per grid:

```bash
./Scripts/run-formation-subcell-source-census.sh
```

![Formation Flight common median-phase geometry and population-weighted boundary-source convergence](Docs/Media/formation-flight-subcell-source-convergence.png)

c16/c18/c20 complete in `1016.72/1367.68/2544.79 s` locally on Apple M4.
Every case is finite and overlap-free; worst source reconstruction, force
closure, torque closure, and final-cycle periodic difference are
`8.06e-8`, `7.47e-7`, `3.19e-6`, and `2.395%`. The selected scalar geometry
curvature is smooth at `0.150`, but the direction-resolved areal-link,
conditional-population, and full population-weighted-source curvatures are
`0.785`, `0.587`, and `0.884`. The preregistered classification is therefore
`mixedPopulationWeightedSource`, not convergence. Reflected, interpolation,
and moving-wall component curvatures are `0.924`, `0.997`, and `0.560`, so no
single component yet owns the residual.

The first analysis pass used the decomposed incoming sum instead of the exact
preregistered production incoming value. The independent audit rejected it
`62/64`; that failed audit is preserved byte-for-byte. A documented narrow
post-run correction changed the headline curvature by only `1.2e-7`, did not
change thresholds or classification, and passes the corrected independent
audit `66/66`. This result originally authorized only the two next-best
deterministic offsets (`[0.5,0.75,0.5]` and `[0.25,0,0.5]`) to test phase
robustness before any quantitative formation-power ladder.

The first authorized alternate phase is now complete under a separate pre-CFD
contract:

```bash
PATH=".build/formation-analysis-venv/bin:$PATH" \
  ./Scripts/run-formation-subcell-source-offset2.sh
```

![Formation Flight alternate-phase source robustness](Docs/Media/formation-flight-subcell-source-offset2-convergence.png)

The deterministic second-ranked offset `[0.5,0.75,0.5]` scores `0.843757`,
only `2.18%` above the selected representative score. The unchanged
production-TRT c16/c18/c20 runs complete in `397.70/772.67/1114.85 s`
(`2285.22 s` total). Every case is finite and overlap-free; worst source
reconstruction, force closure, torque closure, and final-cycle periodic
difference are `8.32e-8`, `6.25e-7`, `2.38e-6`, and `2.293%`.

The alternate direction-resolved areal-link, conditional-population, and exact
population-weighted-source curvatures are `0.617`, `0.602`, and `0.575`.
Reflected, interpolation, and moving-wall components are `0.546`, `0.606`, and
`1.055`. The source improves substantially from `0.884` but remains above the
frozen `0.5` smooth boundary; the two-offset mean is `0.584`. The locked result
therefore remains `mixedPopulationWeightedSource`, with independent
reconstruction passing `109/109` checks. Scalar geometry curvature at this
phase is `1.177`, so the result is correctly reported as nonsmooth at both
tested offsets—not misattributed to the population operator alone. Only the
final authorized offset `[0.25,0,0.5]` may complete the minimal robustness set;
formation-power convergence and benefit remain unclaimed.

That final robustness decision is now complete:

```bash
BIRDFLOW_ANALYSIS_PYTHON="$PWD/.build/formation-analysis-venv/bin/python" \
  ./Scripts/run-formation-subcell-source-offset3.sh
```

![Formation Flight three-phase source robustness decision](Docs/Media/formation-flight-subcell-source-three-offset-convergence.png)

The final offset `[0.25,0,0.5]` completes in `497.74/891.05/1630.52 s` at
c16/c18/c20. Every new case passes unchanged finiteness, overlap, owner,
periodicity, branch, sample-completeness, and reconstruction gates. Across all
three deterministic phases, individual source curvatures are
`0.884/0.575/0.689`; the direction-resolved three-phase mean areal-link,
conditional-population, and exact-source curvatures are
`0.581/0.564/0.596`.

Maximum pairwise exact-source phase spread is only `1.384%`, comfortably below
the frozen `5%` uncertainty gate, but mean source curvature remains above the
unchanged `0.5` smooth boundary. The preregistered quantitative power gate
therefore fails as `mixedPopulationWeightedSourceMean`. Mean reflected,
interpolation, and moving-wall curvatures are `0.621/0.677/0.861`; no single
term owns the residual. The independent raw-artifact audit passes `190/190`.
The wider formation-power map remains blocked; the next admissible allocation
is an archive-only c18 direction/component residual-covariance selector before
one focused phase trace.

That zero-CFD selector is complete under a locked pre-analysis contract:

```bash
BIRDFLOW_ANALYSIS_PYTHON="$PWD/.build/formation-analysis-venv/bin/python" \
  ./Scripts/run-formation-source-residual-covariance.sh
```

![Formation Flight c18 source residual selector](Docs/Media/formation-flight-source-residual-covariance.png)

The exact c18 residual against h-linear c16/c20 endpoints is concentrated in
the leader's reflected momentum-exchange term at D3Q19 `q=5`, direction
`[0,0,+1]`. It owns `21.788%` of the positive systematic-alignment ledger
against a frozen `10%` requirement and agrees in all `3/3` lattice offsets.
The opposite reflected direction `q=6` contributes another `16.520%`, exposing
a vertical reflected-population pair rather than a diffuse all-stencil error.
The deterministic strongest trace anchor is `[0.25,0.25,0.75]`; residual
component closure is `1.37e-8`. The independent audit passes `57/57`, and the
selector executes zero fluid timesteps. Exactly one c18 final-cycle temporal
trace is now authorized for leader reflected momentum exchange, `q=5`, at that
offset. It is diagnostic only and does not reopen the power map.

That single preregistered trace is now complete:

```bash
BIRDFLOW_ANALYSIS_PYTHON="$PWD/.build/formation-analysis-venv/bin/python" \
  ./Scripts/run-formation-focused-source-trace.sh
```

![Formation Flight leader q5 final-cycle source trace](Docs/Media/formation-flight-focused-source-trace.png)

The read-only diagnostic records all `4,820` steps of the final c18 cycle and
reproduces both locked coupled-load summaries and the locked phase-`0.785062`
q5 census exactly: both relative differences are zero. Reconstruction closes
to `2.71e-7`, force/torque closure remains `6.83e-7/3.19e-6`, periodic power
difference remains `2.213%`, and the independent audit passes `59/59` checks.
The production Metal kernel and GPU data layout remain byte-identical to the
baseline.

The preregistered result is `cycleDistributedBranchAssociated`: the shortest
circular window containing half of the phase-binned centered q5 reflected
energy spans `0.4844` cycles, wider than the `0.35` localization limit, while
per-link reflected exchange has `|r|=0.4284` association with near/far branch
occupancy. Total reflected exchange is almost entirely controlled by q5 link
support (`r=0.9988` with link count), and no halfway-fallback link appears.
Therefore a narrow phase-window ladder is rejected. The next justified test is
sparse matched-phase c16/c20 sampling stratified by near/far occupancy—not a
second c18 trace, a broad power map, or a production force change.

See the [scientific contract and scouting matrix](Docs/FORMATION_FLIGHT_OBSERVATORY.md).

The next experimental validation source is now qualified without weakening the
measured-data contract. Deetjen et al.'s Ringneck-dove deposit provides
synchronized processed 3D surfaces, kinematics, and measured horizontal and
vertical aerodynamic-force histories. The selected `OB` flight can be acquired
as a CRC-locked 15 MB engineering subset or a 671 MB subset including its full
surface instead of downloading the 19.3 GB archive. See
[`Docs/DEETJEN_DOVE_BENCHMARK.md`](Docs/DEETJEN_DOVE_BENCHMARK.md). Its inertia
remains modeled, so it advances prescribed-force validation—not measured
schema-2 free flight.

The decoded surface is now a committed 3.73 MB float32 sequence with one fixed
topology for the body, measured left wing, explicitly mirrored right wing, and
tail. It uses the deposited laboratory motion without an artificial periodic
wrap. The compact mesh stays 128 triangles below the current Metal identifier
limit. Independent CPU reconstruction passes every binary, topology, area,
coordinate-bound, and adjacent-frame wall-speed check; the exact artifacts are
[`manifest.json`](ValidationInputs/deetjen-ob-f03-surface-v1/manifest.json) and
[`deetjen-dove-surface-cpu-parity.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-surface-cpu-parity.json).
The geometry-only Apple M4 replay then dispatches the generic indexed Metal
prepare/raster/resolve path for all 144 frames on a `59 x 53 x 50` grid. It
preserves all four components every frame, matches CPU occupancy exactly at five
milestones, and bounds wall-velocity and signed-distance differences by
`2.182e-5` lattice and `1.574e-5` cells. Five additional fractional-time probes
exercise interpolation between stored frames. The archived 7.02-second result is
[`deetjen-dove-indexed-metal-geometry.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-indexed-metal-geometry.json).
It deliberately executes no collision or force kernel, so aerodynamic agreement
remains open.

The following production integration gate is deliberately short and isolated:
periodic boundaries and zero sponge leave the moving surface as the only fluid-
momentum source. In `0.24 s`, eight steps exercise 39 newly covered cells, 53
newly uncovered cells, and 101,262 persistent boundary links through the
production interpolated-link, conservative moving-domain force, and TRT fluid
kernels. Direct before/after fluid momentum closes against the recorded load at
`1.789e-5` relative RMS, with `3.8846e-8 kg m/s` maximum absolute residual.
Evidence is
[`deetjen-dove-indexed-production-coupling.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-indexed-production-coupling.json).
This accepts coupling and impulse accounting, not developed flow or agreement
with the measured force platform.

The deposited force-processing and muscle-model scripts now close the last
input-side ambiguity independently. They establish that platform `FxWings`
maps to source world-forward `y`, both stored platform channels must be negated
to obtain force on the bird, and source world `[y,z]` maps to BirdFlow `[x,z]`.
The resulting measured target is therefore
`[-FxWings, unavailable, -FzWings]`; lateral force is deliberately absent, not
zero-filled. Nearest-sample registration and integer camera arithmetic agree
at all 144 surface frames, with 143 explicit half-frame interpolation samples
between them. The 287-sample target, source-code registration, and independent
committed-input audit are
[`deetjen-ob-f03-force-v1.json`](ValidationInputs/deetjen-ob-f03-force-v1.json),
[`deetjen-dove-force-registration.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-force-registration.json),
and
[`deetjen-dove-force-target-cpu-parity.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-force-target-cpu-parity.json).
This clears a coarse prescribed-motion pilot, not experimental agreement or
the refinement ladder.

That pilot is now executed and archived rather than silently tuned. It advances
the measured motion through nonperiodic far-field TRT at 16 fluid steps per
2 kHz force sample. The authors' analysis window is scored only from `0.025` to
`0.118 s` (187 samples), after a locked 800-step pre-roll. At the deliberately
coarse `0.01 m` grid, the source viscosity would require `tau+=0.50001469`,
below the single-precision guard, so the run uses a declared `tau+=0.501`
viscosity floor—`68.07x` the source viscosity—and applies no experimental-
agreement gate.

The Apple M4 pilot stops before comparison: the first sampled negative D3Q19
population occurs at step 176 (`5.5 ms`), direction 7, fluid cell
`[31,35,29]`, only `0.0764` cells from the surface; the load becomes nonfinite
at step 331. The independent artifact audit passes while the integration gate
fails. This is a useful negative result: force normalization, target sign, and
the scored window are not the immediate blocker. Evidence is
[`deetjen-dove-coarse-force-pilot.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-coarse-force-pilot.json)
and
[`deetjen-dove-coarse-force-pilot-audit.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-coarse-force-pilot-audit.json).
The fixed-input collision screen is now complete with population diagnostics at
every step. Production TRT first becomes negative at step 150 (`4.6875 ms`) in
the same direction-7 cell. Positivity-preserving regularized BGK and RR3 both
finish all 800 pre-roll steps with finite loads and positive populations.
Regularized BGK activates its convex correction in 55 cell-steps
(`2.013e-7` of all cell-steps); RR3 activates in 28 (`1.025e-7`). The archive
and independent audit are
[`deetjen-dove-collision-pre-roll-ab.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-collision-pre-roll-ab.json)
and
[`deetjen-dove-collision-pre-roll-ab-audit.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-collision-pre-roll-ab-audit.json).
Both candidates then replayed the same 800 steps with a fixed control surface
five cells outside the swept bird and outside the six-cell sponge. The
conservative load closed against independent momentum storage plus surface flux
at `0.07944%` relative RMS for regularized BGK and `0.07987%` for RR3. A second
whole-domain before/after fluid ledger, corrected only for measured far-field
and sponge impulse, closed at `0.11459%` and `0.11453%`. No solid crossed the
control surface. The complete histories and independently reconstructed
arithmetic are
[`deetjen-dove-collision-momentum-closure.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-collision-momentum-closure.json)
and
[`deetjen-dove-collision-momentum-closure-audit.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-collision-momentum-closure-audit.json).
Both candidates then completed the fixed 3,776-step extended pilot through all
187 registered comparison samples. Every-step diagnostics remained finite and
positive. Regularized BGK retained only 55 corrected cell-steps
(`4.265e-8` of all cell-steps), while RR3 retained 28 (`2.171e-8`). Their
phase histories are close: endpoint and interval-mean pairwise normalized RMS
differences are `0.656%` and `0.882%`. The archive and independent
reconstruction are
[`deetjen-dove-collision-extended-pilot.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-collision-extended-pilot.json)
and
[`deetjen-dove-collision-extended-pilot-audit.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-collision-extended-pilot-audit.json).
The endpoint measured-force errors (`5.665`/`5.676`) and interval errors
(`2.274`/`2.264`) are recorded but not acceptance gates because this grid uses
`68.07x` source viscosity. The subsequent fixed-physics D=8/D=12 discriminator
held physical domain, thickness, viscosity, Mach, geometry, timing, and gates
constant. Both operators cleared both grids; their trend scores were nearly
tied (`0.12545`/`0.12508`) and disagreement decreased from `0.882%` to
`0.816%`. The preregistered cross-canonical rule therefore selected RR3 and
authorized only its D=16 run. That completion stopped at step `751/7,552` on a
negative direction-0 population `0.215` cells from the surface while loads
remained finite. The negative result is independently audited; no second D=16
operator or unavailable force-convergence value was substituted.

The follow-up sparse provenance replay captures steps `747...751` at that cell
without modifying production state. Its duplicate stage algebra predicts every
actual RR3 direction-0 write bit-for-bit. At step 751, direction 0 is still
positive after reconstruction (`0.005964`), but moving-boundary reconstruction
has already made directions `2, 8, 12, 13, 16` negative. The resulting local
speed is `1.00746` lattice units (Mach `1.74497`), beyond the direction-0
equilibrium positivity limit `0.816497`. RR3's positivity scale collapses to
zero and collision writes the negative equilibrium `-0.00342597`; topology
refill, far field, and sponge are excluded. The archived capture and independent
RR3 reconstruction are
[`deetjen-dove-d16-population-stage-provenance.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-d16-population-stage-provenance.json)
and
[`deetjen-dove-d16-population-stage-provenance-audit.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-d16-population-stage-provenance-audit.json).

The next sparse replay decomposes all 17 moving-boundary directions at steps
750 and 751. It matches the stage archive within `1.892e-10` and closes every
reflected + auxiliary + wall sum within `1.747e-10`. The negative direction set
changes from `2, 3, 10` to `2, 8, 12, 13, 16`; at failure, all reflected
populations and auxiliary contributions are nonnegative, while the wall
correction is negative in all five. Four links are already halfway fallbacks,
and moving-wall halfway fixes none; removing the wall term makes all five
positive. This clears interpolation and inherited reflection as the primary
repair surface and isolates moving-wall correction admissibility. Evidence is
[`deetjen-dove-d16-boundary-term-decomposition.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-d16-boundary-term-decomposition.json)
with its
[`independent audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-d16-boundary-term-decomposition-audit.json).

The locked one-cell moving-wall discriminator then reuses those archives
without rerunning the fluid simulation. Scaling the wall correction by the
pre-step local density (`0.030193`, candidate A) removes all five negative
populations, leaves a `5.580e-5` minimum, and restores equilibrium
admissibility at lattice Mach `0.5482` without a positivity limiter. A
reference-density correction with a worst-link positivity scale (candidate B)
also survives, but requires an active global scale of `0.11505`. Candidate A
therefore advances only to a controlled force/momentum-ledger experiment; it
is not enabled in production. Evidence is
[`deetjen-dove-d16-moving-wall-admissibility-ab.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-d16-moving-wall-admissibility-ab.json)
with its
[`independent audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-d16-moving-wall-admissibility-ab-audit.json).

Candidate A has now passed its controlled D=16 production-ledger experiment.
On Apple M4 it completed the retained `751`-step failure horizon in `22.81 s`
on the unchanged `149 x 136 x 131` grid. The minimum population remained
positive at `1.634e-8`; the near-wing and global relative RMS force/momentum
residuals were `4.719e-4` and `5.306e-4`, respectively, against the locked
`0.005` limit. The control surface remained roughly 11 cells outside the swept
bird, no solid link crossed it, and the opt-in wall candidate used no wall
positivity limiter. Only two recursive-collision corrections occurred
(`1.003e-9` of cell-steps). Production still uses the reference-density wall
law: this result authorizes only a full registered-window D=16 candidate-A
run. Evidence is
[`deetjen-dove-d16-moving-wall-ledger.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-d16-moving-wall-ledger.json)
with its independently reconstructed
[`nine-check audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-d16-moving-wall-ledger-audit.json).

The source-locked full-window promotion also passes. Candidate A completes all
`7,552` D=16 steps in `293.34 s`, retains a positive `1.025e-8` minimum
population, and captures all 187 registered force samples. Near-wing and
global relative RMS residuals are `6.247e-4` and `8.312e-4`, still well below
`0.005`; only 34 RR3 corrections occur (`1.696e-9` of cell-steps), with no
wall limiter or production-default change. The descriptive two-component
force error is `2.1731` normalized RMS: stability and accounting are cleared,
but the fixed `68.07x` viscosity floor and absent candidate-specific spatial
refinement prohibit experimental agreement. Evidence is
[`deetjen-dove-d16-moving-wall-full-window.json`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-d16-moving-wall-full-window.json)
and its independent
[`11-check audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-d16-moving-wall-full-window-audit.json).

The preregistered candidate-A spatial discriminator is now complete—and it
honestly rejects clearance. Full-window D=8 and D=12 runs both pass positivity,
all 187 registered bins, and the independent near-wing/global ledgers; the
existing D=16 archive is reused byte-for-byte. Force-history change decreases
monotonically from `12.705%` (D8→D12) to `6.268%` (D12→D16), while fine-pair
mean and impulse differences are only `1.058%`. However, `6.268%` exceeds the
preregistered `5%` force-history limit, so spatial refinement and production
promotion remain blocked. The green independent audit authenticates this
locked rejection. Evidence is the
[`preregistration`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-spatial-preregistration.json),
[`D8 case`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-d8-moving-wall-full-window.json),
[`D12 case`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-d12-moving-wall-full-window.json),
[`discriminator`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-spatial-discriminator.json),
and [`independent audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-spatial-discriminator-audit.json).

The zero-simulation phase localization rejects an immediate D=20 allocation.
The D12-to-D16 difference is mixed rather than a single event or smooth
distributed truncation: 27 of 187 bins carry half its squared difference,
the strongest 5 ms window carries only `16.81%`, yet normalized adjacent-bin
roughness is `1.351` and `50.27%` of non-DC spectral energy is high-frequency.
Topology correction explains only `12.62%`; near-wing/global ledger-residual
differences are only `0.375%/0.749%` of the force difference. Thus neither a
topology spike nor closure-accounting error explains the miss, but its rough
inter-grid structure is not evidence for smooth asymptotic convergence. See
the [`phase-localization artifact`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-spatial-localization.json)
and [`independent audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-spatial-localization-audit.json).

The source-locked lag/band discriminator then eliminates sub-bin force
registration as the dominant mechanism. The best global shift is only
`-0.02` force bins (`-10 us`), and five-fold held-out validation improves the
D12-to-D16 comparison by just `1.506%`. A nonperiodic 200 Hz low-pass reduces
the normalized difference from `6.268%` to `4.253%`, but retains only `74.27%`
of combined force energy against the frozen `99%` requirement. Filtering away
one quarter of the physical signal cannot be relabeled as convergence.
Neither broadband estimator noise nor coherent low-band grid bias is therefore
established; the result remains `mixed-unresolved`, the original `5%` raw gate
is unchanged, and D=20 remains blocked. The
[`lag/band artifact`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-spatial-lag-band.json)
and [`11-check independent audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-spatial-lag-band-audit.json)
make that negative result reproducible without another fluid simulation.

The follow-up fixed-geometry temporal canonical runs in `10.82 s` and removes
topology and evolving kinematics entirely. At the most discrepant archived
phase (`26.5 ms`), both D12 and D16 hold the same measured geometry and wall
velocity for eight 0.5 ms bins while recording every conservative-force
substep. Endpoint sampling differs by `19.587%`; sample-centered trapezoidal
and direct impulse-preserving aggregation reduce this to `9.760%` and
`9.487%`. Aggregation therefore removes `51.56%` of the endpoint disagreement,
but the authoritative impulse-preserving history still fails 5%. The complete
eight-bin impulses differ by only `0.864%`, both momentum ledgers pass below
`0.036%`, topology correction is exactly zero, and the independent 13-check
audit passes. Classification remains `mixed-unresolved`; the original raw
rejection and D20 block are unchanged. Evidence is the locked
[`preregistration`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-temporal-sampling-preregistration.json),
[`Metal result`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-temporal-sampling.json),
and [`independent audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-temporal-sampling-audit.json).

The preregistered 24-bin extension rules out startup relaxation. Its
independent restart reproduces every original eight-bin vector exactly.
Impulse-preserving D12/D16 history differences are `9.487%`, `9.929%`, and
`9.961%` for the 8/16/24-bin prefixes; the three eight-bin blocks are
`9.487%`, `28.208%`, and `12.379%`. The late block is `30.48%` worse than the
first, while the full 24-bin cumulative impulse difference reaches `4.716%`.
Both 576/768-step cases retain positive populations, exact zero topology, and
sub-`0.069%` ledgers. The locked classification is therefore
`persistent-fixed-wall-grid-disagreement`: temporal aggregation matters, but
neither longer duration nor cumulative cancellation clears the force history.
The [`duration preregistration`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-temporal-duration-preregistration.json),
[`24-bin Metal result`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-temporal-duration.json),
and [`13-check independent audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-temporal-duration-audit.json)
preserve that negative result. D20 and production promotion remain blocked.

The geometry-only follow-up completes in `4.99 s` on Apple M4 and enumerates
the exact production solid-to-fluid D3Q19 convention at the same `26.5 ms`
phase without allocating populations. Metal and the independent CPU raster
match every occupancy cell and every link count; force-relevant aggregate
parity is within `0.182%`. D12→D16 total link measure changes only `1.362%`,
the worst component changes `2.301%`, the 20-bin interpolation-fraction total
variation is `3.143%`, and the worst grid-to-grid mean wall-velocity change is
only `0.418%` of triangle-quadrature RMS. Area and interpolation therefore
clear. The left-wing deposited mean velocity does not: its independent
thickened-triangle error is `10.742%` at D12 and `10.379%` at D16 against the
frozen `10%` limit. The locked classification is
`wall-velocity-deposition-bias`; D20 remains blocked. The version-2 contract
also records why its pointwise CPU tolerance was corrected to the repository's
pre-existing geometry-parity envelope while adding a stricter `0.5%` complete
link-aggregate gate. Evidence is the
[`preregistration`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-link-geometry-preregistration.json),
[`geometry-only result`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-link-geometry.json),
and [`13-check independent audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-link-geometry-audit.json).

The follow-up velocity-sampling A/B advances no fluid and completes in
`21.22 s`. It reproduces the archived production moments exactly, then tests
both endpoint-interpolated velocity and an exact same-component
triangle-barycentric velocity at every reconstructed link intersection.
Neither explains the left-wing miss: the exact candidate changes the worst
mean error from `10.742%` to `10.783%`, while endpoint interpolation worsens
it to `11.430%`. Instead, the link-location check exposes a maximum
offset-surface residual of `0.874` cell against the frozen `0.75`-cell limit
(`0.0696`-cell RMS still passes). The classification is therefore
`signed-distance-intersection-placement-bias`; no velocity repair or
production change is authorized. Evidence is the locked
[`A/B preregistration`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-link-velocity-preregistration.json),
[`direction-resolved result`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-link-velocity.json),
and [`13-check independent audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-link-velocity-audit.json).

The preregistered outlier localizer then scans all `25,262` D12 and `45,514`
D16 links in `0.40 s`, again without populations or force evaluation. Only
`8` and `7` links exceed `0.75` cell—`0.0251%` and `0.0122%` of total link
measure. None is on a true mesh boundary; `7/8` and `7/7` lie within `0.25`
cell of another component's physical offset surface. Their dominant D3Q19
directions differ and contain only `25.0%`/`28.6%` of outlier measure, rejecting
a common stencil-direction association. The locked result is
`mesh-edge-or-component-junction-associated`, descriptively narrowed to
component junctions. It authorizes only an exact offset-surface ray-root A/B
on these 15 archived links. Evidence is the
[`localization preregistration`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-link-intersection-preregistration.json),
[`per-link archive`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-link-intersection.json),
and [`binary-mesh 13-check audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-link-intersection-audit.json).

The exact ray-root A/B resolves those 15 links in `0.072 s`. Every solid/fluid
endpoint pair selects different nearest components, and every fluid endpoint
selects the previously recorded alternate component. Linear interpolation is
therefore blending two different surface-distance functions. Exact global-
union roots remain far from production: junction RMS shifts are `0.519` cell
on D12 and `0.943` on D16, with a `1.136`-cell maximum against the unchanged
`0.10` RMS/`0.75` maximum limits. D16's exact global roots are all the owner
roots, so its owner-to-union improvement is zero. Numerical roots close below
`7.0e-7` cell and a separate NumPy reconstruction agrees. The locked result is
`junction-global-root-linearization-bias`; no production change or fluid run
is authorized. Evidence is the
[`ray-root preregistration`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-link-ray-root-preregistration.json),
[`15-link A/B`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-link-ray-root.json),
and [`independent 13-check audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-link-ray-root-audit.json).

The follow-on coefficient discriminator evaluates the exact production
interpolated-bounce-back algebra on those same 15 links in under `0.04 ms`,
without geometry search or populations. Replacing linear `q` with the exact
global-union `q` changes the `q=0.5` stencil branch on `3/8` D12 links and all
`7/7` D16 links. The measure-weighted coefficient-vector L1 change reaches
`1.723` on D12 and `2.782` on D16, with a `3.189` maximum against frozen
`0.10` RMS and `0.25` maximum limits. The independently reproduced result is
`branch-changing-coefficient-sensitive`. This historically cleared only the
narrow captured-population replay resolved immediately below; by itself it did
not establish a force correction or authorize production or D20. Evidence is the
[`coefficient preregistration`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-link-coefficient-preregistration.json),
[`15-link coefficient archive`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-link-coefficient.json),
and [`independent 12-check audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-link-coefficient-audit.json).

The decisive follow-up captures the actual production primitives on all eight
D12 outliers at every one of the `576` fixed-phase steps: `4,608` link-step
records in `10.02 s`. The first diagnostic archive is intentionally retained:
it exposed four production halfway fallbacks and failed source reproduction
because it attempted a near-wall counterfactual where the required farther
fluid node was solid. Contract revision 2 preserves every `10%` local and `1%`
global materiality threshold while applying the same feasibility rule to exact
`q`. Only three links can actually change branches; one exact root must retain
halfway fallback. Production then reconstructs within `3.32e-9`, with zero
source-record mismatches, positive populations, and both momentum ledgers below
`5.94e-4` relative RMS.

The realized exact-`q` effect is small: `1.822%` population RMS, `1.094%`
outlier-force RMS, `0.1085%` of global force RMS, and `0.4428%` of global
impulse. A separate Python implementation rebuilds all populations, forces,
torques, step reductions, impulses, hashes, and the transparent revision with
all 12 checks passing. The locked classification is
`realized-population-insensitive`; it rejects a boundary-law A/B and D16 replay
for these sparse links and leaves production unchanged. Evidence is the
[`fallback-aware preregistration`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-link-population-fallback-preregistration.json),
[`4,608-sample Metal archive`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-link-population-fallback.json),
and [`independent audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-link-population-fallback-audit.json).
The distributed follow-up is now complete. A read-only Metal capture decomposes
every production boundary link at every fixed-phase step—`25,262 × 576` links
on D12 and `45,514 × 768` on D16—into base reflection, moving-wall correction,
and interpolation residual. It closes against production force to
`6.31e-6`/`5.01e-6` relative RMS, reproduces the prior 24-bin histories below
`2.63e-5`, preserves positivity and both momentum ledgers, and records zero
metadata or link-classification mismatches.

The result is deliberately not oversold. Base reflection supplies `89.90%` of
the full-window aligned D12/D16 delta, but the eight-bin winners are reflection,
moving wall, and moving wall. No term reaches the frozen `60%` dominance gate
in all three blocks; no component, D3Q19 direction, or `q` bin reaches the
spatial `60%` gate; and `518/1,440` active joint bins are required for `80%` of
absolute aligned contribution. The independently reconstructed classification
is therefore `mixed-term-distributed-grid-bias`. D20 and production changes
remain blocked. Evidence is the
[`distributed-force preregistration`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-distributed-force-preregistration.json),
[`D12/D16 Metal archive`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-distributed-force.json),
and [`independent 14-check audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-distributed-force-audit.json).

The preregistered covariance follow-up now closes the cancellation mechanism
without another fluid run. Base reflection plus moving wall is the dominant
pair in all three eight-bin blocks and is always canceling. Its interaction is
`-9.400×` the small residual total-delta energy; the block values are `-3.732×`,
`-32.440×`, and `-163.207×`. The large ratios are expected when two larger
terms nearly cancel. The centered/mean identity shows that `98.324%` of the
pair's absolute decomposition comes from opposing mean offsets, not phase
fluctuations. Energy closure is `1.78e-7` relative and an independent Python
implementation passes all nine checks. The classification is
`robust-canceling-mean-offset-dominated-pair-covariance`. Evidence is the
[`covariance preregistration`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-force-covariance-preregistration.json),
[`archive-only report`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-force-covariance.json),
and [`independent audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-force-covariance-audit.json).

The exact paired spatial allocation is also complete. It assigns every within-
and cross-bin interaction symmetrically, closes the global mean interaction to
`1.12e-14` relative, and produces byte-identical reports across independent
processes. No axis clears the frozen `60%` gate: left wing leads components at
`44.39%`, direction 2 leads stencil directions at `10.19%`, and `q` bin 13
leads interpolation fractions at `10.49%`. Reaching `80%` requires `591/1,440`
joint bins, while cancellation-supporting and opposing absolute contributions
split `50.10%`/`49.90%`. The independently reproduced classification is
`distributed-spatial-mean-cancellation`; a targeted primitive capture is
rejected. Evidence is the
[`spatial-interaction preregistration`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-spatial-interaction-preregistration.json),
[`exact allocation`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-spatial-interaction.json),
and [`independent audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-moving-wall-spatial-interaction-audit.json).

The source-property/Reynolds audit is now complete without another fluid run.
The deposited `MuscleModel.m` exactly supplies `rho=1.18 kg/m^3` and
`mu=1.849e-5 Pa s`; all D8/D12/D16 lattice reconstructions close the declared
`68.07195x` viscosity floor. These are author-code conventions, not recorded
same-flight atmospheric measurements: the paper reports no ambient temperature,
pressure, humidity, or Reynolds number. Its Table 2 flight speed is
`1.23 +/- 0.13 m/s` across the study.

The solver's source-property Reynolds proxy is `128,813`, based on the converted
maximum surface speed `25.2304 m/s` and engineering length `0.08 m`. The closest
source-data proxy is `102,417`, based on the deposited maximum blade-element
speed `21.3687 m/s` and the selected bird's area/radius mean chord
`0.0751015 m`; the definitions differ by `25.773%`. Thus the viscosity source is
confirmed, but the registered Reynolds number must remain explicitly labeled an
engineering maximum-wall-speed proxy. The unchanged `tau+ >= 0.50005` margin is
first met at D28 under fixed-Courant scaling; D20 cannot meet it. Evidence is the
[`source-scaling preregistration`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-scaling-preregistration.json),
[`equation-only report`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-scaling.json),
and [`independent ten-check audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-scaling-audit.json).

That diagnostic and the first margin-compliant grid are now complete. The
preregistered D16 source-viscosity A/B preserved the public `tau+>=0.50005`
guard and used a package-only `0.50002` construction floor. Both regularized
operators completed all 1,600 steps at `tau+=0.50002939`. Their minimum
populations were `9.34e-9` and `1.05e-8`; worst near-wing/global momentum
residuals were `0.0686%` and `0.0658%`; correction activated in only 46 and 7
of `4.247 billion` cell-steps. The independent implementation passes all 15
checks. Evidence is the
[`D16 preregistration`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-d16-preregistration.json),
[`two-operator report`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-d16-ab.json),
and [`independent audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-d16-audit.json).

The deterministic evidence rule selected RR3 for D28. The locked
`259 x 238 x 229` case contains `14,116,018` cells, uses a conservative
`3.61 GB` working-set estimate, and clears the normal production constructor at
`tau+=0.50005144`. Its 2,800-step pre-roll passed first. The full-window
preregistration was then frozen before output was observed, with RR3, 13,216
steps, 56 steps per comparison bin, 187 bins, `0.5%` momentum-ledger limits,
and a `5%` correction-intrusion limit unchanged.

On Apple M4, that single D28 allocation completed in `2,706.01 s`. Minimum
population remained positive at `4.84e-9`; near-wing/global momentum residuals
were `0.0824%/0.1507%`; correction activated in `0.00136%` of cell-steps; and
all 187 registered force bins were recorded. The independent audit reconstructs
all 13,216 step-level ledger records and every bin, and all 17 checks pass.
Evidence is the
[`D28 preregistration`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-d28-preregistration.json),
[`production-margin pre-roll`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-d28-pre-roll.json),
[`pre-registered full-window contract`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-d28-full-window-preregistration.json),
[`full-window report`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-d28-full-window.json),
and [`independent full-window audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-d28-full-window-audit.json).

The force comparison is deliberately descriptive: joint normalized RMS error
is `2.1357`. Exploratory decomposition finds recognizable vertical-force shape
(`r=0.848`) but a `39.0%` high mean, while horizontal force has weak shape
agreement (`r=0.343`) and a `74.5%` mean deficit. A best vertical correlation
lag of only `2 ms` rules out a simple large phase shift. See the explicitly
post-hoc [`force diagnosis`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-d28-force-diagnosis.json).

The same-physics D32 discriminator is now complete. Its preregistered `296 x
271 x 261` RR3 allocation contains `20,936,376` cells, uses a conservative
`5.36 GB` working-set estimate, and advances source viscosity at
`tau+=0.50005877`. The 3,200-step pre-roll completed in `923.59 s`; its
18-check independent audit authorized only the full window. The separately
preregistered 15,104-step window then completed on Apple M4 in `4,627.86 s`,
recording all 187 force bins. Minimum population remained positive at
`4.69e-9`; near-wing/global relative RMS ledger residuals were
`0.1613%/0.0964%`; correction activated in only `0.00144%` of cell-steps; and
all 17 independent audit checks passed. Evidence is the
[`D32 preregistration`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-d32-preregistration.json),
[`pre-roll`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-d32-pre-roll.json),
[`pre-roll audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-d32-audit.json),

[`full-window report`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-d32-full-window.json),
and [`full-window audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-d32-full-window-audit.json).

The post-result refinement contract was frozen before the two force histories
were compared and inherited the repository's established `5%` fine-pair gate.
Mean force (`0.760%`), impulse (`0.726%`), and peak time (`0%`) are stable, but
the primary phase-resolved history changes `5.632%`; horizontal and vertical
component changes are `7.376%` and `4.661%`. The independently reconstructed
failure therefore blocks D36, grid convergence, production promotion, and
experimental agreement. See the
[`refinement preregistration`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-d28-d32-refinement-preregistration.json),
[`result`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-d28-d32-refinement.json),
and [`audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-d28-d32-refinement-audit.json).

The preregistered D28/D32 `25–30 ms` moving-boundary replay is now complete.
It replays the unmodified production kernel from each identical pre-step state
with four existing force selectors: reflected population, moving-wall
correction, interpolation residual, and cover/uncover topology impulse. Both
grids reproduce their archived force bins exactly; component sums close at
`2.68e-5` and `3.33e-5` relative RMS; and all momentum, positivity, and
correction gates pass. The independent `15/15`-check audit identifies
reflected-population self energy as the preregistered dominant contribution:
`58.43%` of the absolute D32-minus-D28 signed-energy ledger, with the same
leader in both temporal halves. Reflected/topology and
reflected/interpolation interactions cancel `14.68%` and `7.51%`, so this is
not authority to rescale a force term. Evidence is the
[`frozen contract`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-targeted-boundary-preregistration.json),
[`D28 case`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-targeted-boundary-d28.json),
[`D32 case`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-targeted-boundary-d32.json),
[`attribution`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-targeted-boundary.json),
and [`independent audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-targeted-boundary-audit.json).
The failed first runner and its V1 contract remain explicitly archived: they
used the plan Reynolds number instead of source-property Reynolds and were
rejected by the frozen trajectory-reproduction gate.

The selected-link reflected-population discriminator is now complete. Its
preserved V1 negative control passed the numerical and exact-detail identities
but failed the unchanged `50%` coverage gate at `10.03%`. V2 changed only the
observation capacity: D28/D32 completed `3,360/3,840` steps on Apple M4, captured
all 11 endpoints with zero overflow or detail mismatch, reproduced source
reflected force within `8.93e-7/9.34e-7` relative RMS, and covered
`100.0%/83.45%` of absolute X/Z reflected score. The midpoint identity closes
at `5.54e-16`; raw Metal float-force consistency is `1.48e-9`; and an
independent `16/16`-check audit identifies near-wall link composition as the
stable `91.12%` self contribution. Population history is only `0.216%`, while
their interaction contributes `8.659%` with a cancelling sign. See the
[`V2 contract`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-reflected-provenance-preregistration.json),
[`D28 case`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-reflected-provenance-d28.json),
[`D32 case`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-reflected-provenance-d32.json),
[`attribution`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-reflected-provenance.json),
and [`audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-viscosity-reflected-provenance-audit.json).

The frozen-population, zero-fluid conditioned cross-application is complete.
It reconstructs all 64 D28/D32 hybrid states, applies the fixed six-factor
ordering, and uses exact Shapley attribution. Endpoint reconstruction closes at
`5.63e-16`, Shapley force closure at `1.81e-16`, energy closure at `1.17e-16`,
and the largest pooled conditional fallback is only `0.0743%`. Lattice
direction composition is the stable leader in both temporal halves and supplies
`87.66%` of the absolute factor ledger; link-measure scale is the next term at
`11.71%` with a cancelling sign, and every other factor is below `0.34%`. The
[`contract`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-link-composition-discriminator-preregistration.json),
[`result`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-link-composition-discriminator.json),
and [`18-check audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-link-composition-discriminator-audit.json)
are retained in the repository.

The preregistered direction-composition planar canonical is now complete. It
uses four X/Z orientations, two grids (`48/64` cells per fixed one-metre patch),
five subcell phases, and both rest-equilibrium and source-locked reflected-
population profiles: 40 cases total, with no collision, streaming, topology,
or fluid evolution. Metal and an independent CPU enumerator agree on every
per-direction link count. All eight frozen `5%` gates pass: the maximum fine
analytic-vector error is `1.284%`, coarse/fine phase-mean change `2.867%`, fine
phase spread `1.187%`, direction-histogram variation `0.657%`, equilibrium
normal error `0.477%`, and tangential leakage `0.332%`. A retained V1 negative
control documents the exact Float tie-classification failure that motivated a
coordinate-arithmetic-only V2 revision; the independent NumPy audit passes all
14 checks. See the
[`V2 contract`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-direction-composition-canonical-preregistration.json),
[`40-case result`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-direction-composition-canonical.json),
and [`audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-direction-composition-canonical-audit.json).

The source-locked curved direction-only canonical is complete. It reuses the
audited complete-dove Metal/CPU link counts at source sample 53 (`26.5 ms`) on
D12 and D16, all four components, and the same equilibrium and Deetjen midpoint
population profiles—without collision, streaming, topology evolution, or new
Metal execution. Whole-bird opposite-direction counts match exactly and the
equilibrium response cancels exactly. D12-to-D16 whole-surface histogram total
variation is `0.1302%`; the maximum whole-response change is `0.00913%` and the
worst component response change is `0.7111%`, all far below the frozen
`5%/10%` limits. The independent NumPy audit passes `14/14` checks. See the
[`contract`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-curved-direction-composition-canonical-preregistration.json),
[`result`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-curved-direction-composition-canonical.json),
and [`audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-curved-direction-composition-canonical-audit.json).

The preregistered D28/D32 complete-link census is now captured and analyzed at
the same source sample 53 (`26.5 ms`). The production Metal and independent CPU
rasters match exactly across all 144 component/direction bins and both masks.
The static census differs from the already archived moving-run active-link
total by at most `0.7482%`, under the frozen `5%` consistency gate. D28-to-D32
whole histogram TV is `0.06569%`; maximum whole fixed-profile response change
is `0.001161%`; and the worst component histogram/response changes are
`0.2481%/0.1945%`. All eight gates and all `16/16` independent audit checks
pass. The Apple-M4 capture took `0.483 s` internally (`1.01 s` command wall
time) with no populations, collision, streaming, force kernel, or new physics
kernel. See the
[`contract`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-fine-direction-composition-preregistration.json),
[`raw census`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-fine-direction-composition-census.json),
[`discriminator`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-fine-direction-composition-discriminator.json),
and [`audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-fine-direction-composition-audit.json).

The preregistered phase-window extension is also complete. Its exact-parity V1
stopped on four isolated one-cell CPU/Metal disagreements: three surface-sign
ties within `4.9e-6` lattice cells and one component-ownership tie within
`7.7e-6` cells. V1 is retained unchanged. Arithmetic-only V2 permits at most
one independently qualified tie per case while still requiring exact
whole-surface direction counts; all 22 grid/phase cases qualify. All eight
gates pass at all 11 samples. Worst D28-to-D32 whole histogram TV is `0.07833%`,
maximum whole fixed-profile response change is `0.003243%`, and maximum
component histogram/response changes are `0.6251%/0.5665%`. The independent
audit passes `18/18`. See the
[`V2 contract`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-fine-direction-phase-window-preregistration.json),
[`qualified census`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-fine-direction-phase-window-census.json),
[`discriminator`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-fine-direction-phase-window-discriminator.json),
[`audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-fine-direction-phase-window-audit.json),
and retained [`V1 failure`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-fine-direction-phase-window-census-v1-exact-parity-failure.json).

Highest-ROI next experiment: a zero-fluid force-bearing replay separating
moving-wall velocity, interpolation branch, and reflected-population effects
over the same 11 samples. Why: static direction support is now cleared across
the entire force-difference interval, leaving their interaction as the nearest
unresolved force-side mechanism. ROI: it reuses archived populations and the
22 captured geometries before any D36 or hour-scale fluid allocation. D36,
grid convergence, experimental agreement, and production promotion remain
blocked.

## Latest high-Re result

<p align="center">
  <img width="49%" alt="Recursive regularization D8 D12 D16 refinement result" src="ValidationArtifacts/Figures/stationary-wall-recursive-regularization-refinement.png">
  <img width="49%" alt="Recursive regularization D8 D12 duration sensitivity result" src="ValidationArtifacts/Figures/stationary-wall-recursive-regularization-duration.png">
</p>

Recursive-regularized BGK keeps the D=8/12/16 stationary-sphere cases positive, source/force closed, and non-intrusive while correction decreases with refinement. Promotion is still blocked: `Cd = 1.32042, 0.93800, 1.04777` is non-monotonic and the D12→D16 change is `10.476%` against the unchanged `5%` gate.

The cheap ten-convective-time follow-up resolved half the ambiguity:

- D=12 is late-window stable: ninth→tenth change `4.543%`; fifth→tenth change `2.177%`.
- D=8 is not: ninth→tenth change `46.848%`; fifth→tenth change `29.219%`.
- Every positivity, conservation, force-budget, control-isolation, and correction gate still passes.

That D=8-only program is now complete and its negative results are retained.
Two preregistered drag-only analyses rejected a single-period interpretation:
the 30-time trace still produced a Fourier period of `2.492 tU/D` versus a
`0.260 tU/D` autocorrelation selection. A literature-bounded vector-force
multimode test then identified a low transverse mode and drag harmonic at 30
times, but only two complete low-mode blocks fit. The exact-prefix 60-time
extension supplied 11 blocks and tightened the relative 95% drag-confidence
half-width to `4.394%`; nevertheless, the low-band dominance fell to
`1.180 < 1.5` and its peak shifted to `St=0.2318`. More duration therefore did
not stabilize one D8 mode. The independent audit reconstructs all `19/19`
checks for each multimode analysis. D20 remains blocked; the next admissible
question is D8 sub-cell placement/grid-orientation sensitivity, not another
duration run or a relaxed spectral threshold.

## The force-accounting investigation

The prescribed-wing load error was once roughly fivefold. The repository now contains the full chain that found and corrected it:

1. **Load decomposition** showed cover/uncover topology impulse contributed only `0.47%` of mean lift and `2.90%` of mean drag; link exchange dominated.
2. **Conventional versus Galilean-invariant momentum exchange** changed mean loads by less than `1%`, ruling out the wall-frame correction as the main factor.
3. **Independent coefficient reconstruction** recovered the paper denominator exactly from equations and raw forces, ruling out a shared normalization multiplier.
4. **Link-numerator decomposition** localized the sensitivity to cancellation between reflected populations and moving-wall correction.
5. **Near-wing fluid momentum balance** gave `(CL, CD)=(1.18092, 2.04933)` while legacy boundary accumulation gave approximately `(7.51, 9.56)`.
6. **A conservative moving-domain estimator** closed that independent balance within `0.002511/0.000247` maximum phase residuals under a `0.005` gate.
7. **A translating-sphere topology canonical** improved RMS momentum closure by `22,020×` over the retired estimator and made the corrected estimator the production default.
8. **The promoted 20/24-cell flapping ladder** then passed mean-load, phase, symmetry, periodicity, vortex, batching, and grid-change gates without relaxing thresholds.

This sequence is summarized in [`Docs/VALIDATION.md`](Docs/VALIDATION.md); machine-readable ledgers live in [`ValidationArtifacts/`](ValidationArtifacts/).

The package is an original implementation. Its software organization adopts PyFR’s controller/resource/command-graph separation: physical types and reference algebra are isolated from Metal resource orchestration, pipeline states are compiled once per backend, and a fixed GPU command graph is encoded repeatedly. The numerical operators themselves are Metal-specific MSL.

### Per-step coupled path

```text
prepare articulated pose and physical wall velocity
update current and previous solid occupancy
pull-stream 19 populations per fluid cell
apply interpolated moving-boundary reconstruction
recover density, velocity, and isothermal pressure
apply TRT or selected regularized collision + far-field sponge
accumulate link exchange and cover/uncover momentum
reduce force and torque deterministically on the GPU
optionally integrate the rigid torso and orientation
publish a read-only field lease when visualization requests one
```

Newly uncovered nodes are refilled from a local moving-boundary equilibrium. Newly covered nodes contribute their population momentum conversion to the body load. Demonstration and schema-1 prescribed wings remain explicitly massless. Schema 2 instead requires bilateral measured wing mass properties; the GPU applies their phase-resolved internal-momentum reaction to the body and archives left/right hinge reactions.

## Metal engineering

The production path is structured for Apple unified memory and predictable command submission:

- direction-major population storage gives adjacent GPU threads adjacent cell access;
- articulated wing frames are prepared once per timestep rather than once per cell;
- conservative bounds cull expensive bird geometry work;
- measured periodic keyframes are sampled once per timestep with physical rates preserved;
- occupancy and part identity share compact byte masks;
- the first deterministic load reduction is fused into fluid threadgroups;
- prescribed-wing phase loads reduce into a compact cycle buffer without per-step CPU waits;
- sub-cell boundary fractions reuse dormant solid-node population slots instead of allocating a full-grid link buffer;
- command-buffer batches are queued without intermediate CPU waits;
- density and velocity are captured only for the final externally visible step;
- fixed cases skip unused body-integration and intermediate load work; and
- allocation preflight rejects grids exceeding per-buffer or recommended working-set limits before partial allocation.

Optimization is accepted only when numerical state, loads, body state, and validation thresholds remain unchanged. [`Docs/BUILD_REPORT.md`](Docs/BUILD_REPORT.md) records the exact verification boundary and measured host timings.

## Native Metal viewer

```bash
swift run -c release birdflow-viewer
```

The same-process macOS viewer includes:

- pressure or `Cp` on the articulated body;
- arbitrary oblique slices with velocity, normal velocity, or vorticity;
- live world/velocity/vorticity probes and in-plane glyphs;
- RK2 pathlines with CFL subdivision and discontinuity reset;
- physical-unit vorticity and Q criterion;
- GPU classic marching cubes with capacity-safe indirect drawing;
- force, torque, body pose, solver time, render time, dropped-frame, and Q-capacity HUDs;
- versioned run bundles, derived-field keyframes, and exact compressed solver checkpoints.

Visualization receives only completed read-only field leases. Three best-effort slots prevent rendering from waiting the solver; if all slots are busy, the frame is dropped. The standalone compact M4 benchmark recorded `751.4 step/s` without observation and `643.2 step/s` with active offscreen rendering—`14.4%` ordinary GPU contention, zero visualization solver waits, and zero dropped frames.

Every prior published hero is preserved byte-for-byte in the
[`Docs/Media/Progress`](Docs/Media/Progress/README.md) archive, so visual polish
does not erase the project's development history.

See [`Docs/VIEWER.md`](Docs/VIEWER.md) for controls, persistence formats, numerical separation, and verification.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Apple-silicon Mac
- macOS 14 or later
- Xcode command-line tools with Metal compiler support
- Swift 6 or later
- Python 3 with NumPy and Matplotlib for reference/audit plots

### Build and run the local gates

```bash
swift build -c release
swift test -c release
./Scripts/check-metal.sh
python3 Scripts/static-audit.py
./Scripts/validate.sh
```

`check-metal.sh` invokes Apple’s offline compiler on both Metal libraries. `validate.sh` adds the independent reference cases and core production-Metal canonicals. Expensive flapping and high-Re refinement ladders remain explicit commands rather than surprise work inside every local check.

> [!NOTE]
> Validation is local-only. There are intentionally no GitHub Actions workflows, so pushes and pull requests do not consume hosted macOS CI minutes.

Latest recorded local run on Apple M4 (2026-07-17): **125 release tests passed in 945.672 seconds** (`946.19 s` command wall time). The complete local validation gate also retains its prior 125-test debug pass in 1058.650 seconds, independent physical-condition verifier, static Swift/MSL layout audit, offline compilation of both Metal libraries, and moving-wall, translating-body, fixed-sphere, and fixed-wing production-Metal canonicals.

Physical-domain-preserving refinement:

```bash
swift run -c release birdflow \
  --resolution-scale 2 \
  --steps 8192 \
  --report-every 256
```

`--resolution-scale N` multiplies grid dimensions, chord resolution, and sponge width by `N`, reducing `dx` and `dt` by `N`. Multiply the step count by `N` to compare the same physical duration. The executable emits CSV with time, body pose, linear velocity, aerodynamic force, and aerodynamic torque.

The fixed sphere and fixed wing are compact engineering canonicals, not substitutes for publication-scale domain and resolution studies. The accepted prescribed-wing composite is independently audited by:

```bash
python3 Scripts/audit-flapping-refinement.py
python3 Scripts/verify-measured-wing-physical-condition.py
```

## Measured geometry and kinematics

Audit a specimen input without allocating Metal resources:

```bash
.build/release/birdflow replay measured-bird \
  --input /path/to/specimen.json \
  --chord-cells 12 \
  --audit-only \
  --json
```

Replay prescribed motion and retain exact-input provenance plus phase loads:

```bash
.build/release/birdflow replay measured-bird \
  --input /path/to/specimen.json \
  --chord-cells 12 \
  --cycles 5 \
  --archive /path/to/specimen-replay-c12 \
  --json
```

Schema 1 requires SI units, source provenance, a COM-centered principal-axis frame, domain conditions, morphometrics, and independent left/right periodic pose and rate histories. Schema 2 adds measured bilateral wing mass, hinge-relative COM, inertia, and explicit whole-bird mass definitions for free flight. Cubic-Hermite interpolation keeps pose and wall velocity consistent. Preflight rejects invalid phase coverage, domain/sponge collisions, under-resolved thickness, and excessive estimated lattice Mach before Metal allocation.

The bundled complete-bird JSON is a **synthetic conformance fixture**, not a measured specimen. The measured right-wing surface tier is also intentionally wing-only. Read [`Docs/MEASURED_BIRD_DATA.md`](Docs/MEASURED_BIRD_DATA.md) before interpreting any replay.

For a same-specimen schema-2 input, `--load-refinement` runs the locked
five-cycle `8/12/16` load ladder and `--body-refinement --steps N` runs the
same-fluid `1/2/4` body-substep ladder. Free flight records bilateral inertial
hinge reactions and aborts on the first GPU-recorded Mach, clearance, or
non-finite-state event. Add `--momentum-ledger` to a free-flight replay to
archive direct population/body/wing momentum, far-field and sponge sources,
gravity, persistent-link exchange, inferred topology conversion, and both
locked `0.5%` closure gates. `--part-loads` additionally makes that intent
explicit and archives conservative body/left-wing/right-wing/tail loads,
aerodynamic hinge torque, prescribed-wing inertial reaction, required actuator
torque, and signed mechanical power:

```bash
.build/release/birdflow replay measured-bird \
  --input /path/to/schema-2-specimen.json \
  --chord-cells 12 --steps 100 --body-substeps 4 \
  --part-loads --archive /path/to/free-flight-ledger --json
```

For deliberately symmetric input, add `--expect-bilateral-symmetry` to apply
the locked `2%` mirrored force, hinge-torque, and actuator-power gate. It is
opt-in because measured left/right asymmetry can be physical.

For a schema-2 forward-flight specimen with nonzero freestream,
`--trim-search` performs a bounded body-pitch/airspeed Gauss-Newton search. It
uses two-cycle candidates at the requested screening grid, then reruns only the
selected point for at least five cycles before applying the unchanged `5%`
force, moment, and stationarity gates:

```bash
.build/release/birdflow replay measured-bird \
  --input /path/to/schema-2-specimen.json \
  --chord-cells 8 --trim-search --trim-iterations 2 \
  --archive /path/to/trim-search --json
```

The archive retains the byte-identical base input, every candidate result, and
the exact derived best-candidate JSON. Speed and Reynolds number scale together
so physical viscosity is unchanged; measured geometry and wing kinematics are
never tuned. A passing prescribed trim search is still not free-flight
boundedness or grid/body-step acceptance. Hover trim is rejected until the
input declares a physical aerodynamic control variable.

Use that archive's exact selected input for the combined confirmation gate:

```bash
.build/release/birdflow replay measured-bird \
  --input /path/to/trim-search/best-candidate-input.json \
  --chord-cells 8 --free-flight-confirmation \
  --archive /path/to/free-flight-confirmation --json
```

The command starts three independent experiments from the same input: a
minimum five-cycle, four-body-substep free-flight trajectory; a one-cycle
`1/2/4` body-step ladder; and a one-cycle coupled momentum/per-part load audit.
The trajectory must remain within `0.10` chord position drift, `0.05` reference
speed, `5 deg` attitude change, and `0.05` cycle-scaled angular velocity while
also passing runtime, refinement, `0.5%` momentum, and `0.5%` part-sum gates.
Its atomic archive includes the byte-identical input, trajectory CSV, and every
nested report. These are solver boundedness thresholds, not a universal claim
about biological maneuver amplitude or passive stability.

The diagnostic is opt-in and lazily allocates only compact reduction buffers;
normal batched solver/viewer throughput is unchanged. The current missing-data decision is retained in
[`ValidationArtifacts/quantitative-complete-bird-readiness.json`](ValidationArtifacts/quantitative-complete-bird-readiness.json).

## Scientific boundary

BirdFlowMetal targets low-Mach flapping flight and wakes using an isothermal weakly compressible formulation, a uniform Cartesian grid, rigid surfaces, moving occupancy masks, and sub-cell link placement in the prescribed beta-wing benchmark.

Quantitative complete-bird claims still require:

- an actual measured specimen with body, both wings, tail, mass properties, geometry provenance, and synchronized kinematics;
- a surface representation appropriate to the measured feather/wing geometry;
- passing the five-cycle `8/12/16` measured-bird load ladder;
- a passing five-cycle-confirmed prescribed trim search at the declared flight
  condition, followed by the archived `--free-flight-confirmation` gate;
- a passing archived per-part load/actuator report on that specimen, with the
  bilateral symmetry gate enabled only when its input is intentionally
  symmetric;
- a confirmation trajectory that stays inside the declared boundedness and
  per-step Mach/sponge/domain abort bounds, plus its independently restarted
  coupled-momentum/per-part and `1/2/4` rigid-body substep runs;
- same-specimen schema-2 wing inertia and a passing archived hinge-reaction
  treatment (or a separately justified massless-wing scientific model);
- forced channel-flow coverage and any turbulence/flexibility model required by the target regime.

The high-Re stationary-sphere RR3 branch is a collision-operator research gate. It is **not enabled** in flapping or measured-bird replay while its force statistic is unresolved. The accepted prescribed flapping benchmark validates the production moving-boundary/load path; it does not magically validate arbitrary complete-bird morphology or free-flight physics.

[`measured-wing-source-audit.json`](ValidationArtifacts/measured-wing-source-audit.json) locks source filenames, licenses, MD5/SHA-256 digests, coordinate registration, scale reconstruction, surface-area closure, and the fields still missing for complete-bird replay.
The follow-up [`same-specimen source-gap audit`](ValidationArtifacts/maeda-same-specimen-source-gap-audit.json)
enumerates the complete public Maeda collection and separates potentially
recoverable author/zoo records from measurements that likely require a new
campaign. A concise, ready-to-send availability inquiry is in
[`Docs/SAME_SPECIMEN_DATA_REQUEST.md`](Docs/SAME_SPECIMEN_DATA_REQUEST.md).
The independent
[`Deetjen dove source qualification`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-source-qualification.json)
selects one bounded prescribed-force benchmark, locks its remote Zip64 members,
and separates measured force channels from modeled lateral force and inertia.
The follow-up
[`engineering ingestion audit`](ValidationArtifacts/deetjen-dove-engineering-ingestion.json)
CRC/SHA-verifies the selectively acquired nine-member flight, reconstructs the
1000/2000 Hz synchronization, and inventories the real body/wing/tail surfaces.
The follow-up force-registration artifact locks the two deposited processing
scripts, the exact 287-sample BirdFlow force target, and the explicit
unavailable lateral component. The coarse pilot then localizes a near-wall
population-stability failure before the comparison window; experimental CFD
agreement remains open.
